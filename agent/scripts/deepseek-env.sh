# coding config). Agent behaviour must be reproducible and its parameter changes
# must land in git history — the drift experiment depends on knowing when a

# unrelated coding-workflow tweaks with no record.

# ⚠ Only ever source this inside a subshell. In the parent shell it would
# hijack every subsequent `claude` call in the round — including the two
# neutral rulers (dream.sh aspect distill, benchmark-run.sh judge_score).

# `return` when sourced, `exit` when executed.
