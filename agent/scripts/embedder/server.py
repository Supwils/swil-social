"""Local sentence-embedding daemon for the swil-social agent runtime.

Loads BAAI/bge-m3 (multilingual, 1024-dim, 8K context) once at startup, exposes
a single /embed endpoint. Caches by sha256(text) in a sibling SQLite file so
re-embedding the same personality.md or post text is free.

Runs on Apple Silicon (M-series) via PyTorch's MPS backend by default; falls
back to CPU on other hardware. The daemon is managed by launchd:
  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.swil.embedder.plist
See agent/MAINTENANCE.md for install / pause / restart commands.
