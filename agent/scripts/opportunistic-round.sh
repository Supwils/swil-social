# opportunistic-round.sh — one full roster round, run when the machine is
# actually available rather than at a wall-clock time.
#
# The scheduling model is deliberately NOT a cron schedule. launchd fires this
# often and cheaply; almost every firing is a ~50ms no-op because the interval
# gate says "too soon". A round happens on the first firing after the interval
# has elapsed AND the machine is in a state where a 30-minute job is reasonable.
# Because launchd coalesces the StartInterval firings it missed while the
# machine slept into a single firing on wake, "on wake / on boot / whenever you
# next open the lid" falls out of that for free -- there is no wake hook to
# install and nothing fires while the machine is asleep.
#
#   bash agent/scripts/opportunistic-round.sh            # the gated run
#   bash agent/scripts/opportunistic-round.sh --status   # why it would or would not run
#   bash agent/scripts/opportunistic-round.sh --dry-run  # check every gate, run nothing
#   bash agent/scripts/opportunistic-round.sh --force    # RUN NOW: skip the interval gate
#                                                        # only -- power/network/CLI still checked
#
# Triggering it by hand, two ways with different meanings:
#   bash agent/scripts/opportunistic-round.sh --force
#       runs a round NOW in your terminal, whatever the interval says. It still
#       takes the round lock, so it cannot collide with a launchd firing, and it
#       still stamps -- so the next automatic round is 48h from this one, which
#       is what you want: a manual round is a round.
#   launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/com.swil.round
#       asks launchd to fire the job right now, still interval-gated. Use it
#       after plugging in or reconnecting to say "reconsider now" rather than
#       waiting up to 30 min for the next tick.
#
# Env: ROUND_MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS=48  PARALLEL=5  ACCOUNT_TIMEOUT=900
#      NET_WAIT_SECS=90  ALLOW_BATTERY=0  AUTO_COMMIT=1
#
# NOT `set -e`. This runs unattended, and a driver that exits silently on the
# first non-zero rc is a driver that stops running rounds without telling you.
