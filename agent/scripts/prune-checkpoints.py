"""Drop old LangGraph cycle checkpoints, keeping the last N rounds per account.

Every round opens a NEW thread per account -- `thread_id` is
`builtin:<account>:<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS>` -- so nothing ever reuses an old thread
and nothing in the tree deleted them. Measured 2026-08-20: 70 MB for 56 threads,
roughly 35 MB per round, in a gitignored file on one laptop. At the 48h cadence
that is ~500 MB/month and it only goes up.

`swil-agent cycle --resume` needs the account's most recent thread, so keeping
one round back is already enough; the default keeps two, which costs one extra
round of disk and means a prune immediately after a failed round still leaves
something to resume.

    python3 agent/scripts/prune-checkpoints.py --dry-run
    python3 agent/scripts/prune-checkpoints.py --keep 2

Exits 0 when there is nothing to do, and when the database does not exist yet.
This is housekeeping: it must never be the reason a round does not run.
