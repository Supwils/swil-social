    `Board` is the account's POSTING target (`Persona.board` ->
    `_resolve_board_id` -> `create_post`'s `boardId`, `api/resources.py:341`)
    and every one of the 23 accounts carries one, while `Read` is its READING

    `Board` would silently switch all 23 accounts onto board feeds in one
    round, with no operator decision anywhere and no way to run the control
    arm the experiment needs.

    `persona/validators.py` already treats `Read` as a round-trip-validated
    experiment control field for this exact reason, and says so: losing it
    "turns the widest-input arm into an ordinary board reader with nothing in
    any log to say so."

    ABSENT means global, and that is a deliberate default rather than an
    unhandled case: an account with no declared niche has no niche to leave,

    roster ships with 22 of 23 accounts in exactly that state, which makes
    this whole mechanism a strict no-op until an operator assigns the niches.

    The value is stripped but NOT otherwise normalised -- `loader.get_field`
    preserves an experiment control field verbatim on purpose, and a slug
    this function silently case-folded would be a value no operator wrote.
    A mistyped slug therefore reaches the API as written and 404s into the
    ordinary degraded-feed path, where the lab event's `boardRead` names it.

    every single-run assertion anyone could write and make the branch
    untestable and unreproducible, which is the whole reason this parameter

    Order of the two guards matters. A global-scope account returns BEFORE

# ── world context: what `swil.sh login` used to write to disk ─────────────
#
# `swil.sh login` produced three artifacts and `auto-run.sh` read them back:
# `context/now.md` (date + platform activity + news), `context/news_today.md`
# (the shared news cache, inlined into the first), and one
# `context/feed_for_<username>.md` per account (the follow-topics search
# feed). Nothing in this package calls `swil.sh`, and `cycle-one.sh:45`
# dispatches straight to `swil-agent cycle`, so from the 2026-08-19 cutover
# until this code existed the runtime READ two of those files and WROTE none
# -- every account was handed a `now.md` frozen at 2026-08-19 05:30, whose
# header told all 23 of them that the date was the 19th and that they were
# `qiusai`.
#
# Four rulings shape what follows, and none of them is this module's to
# revisit:
#
#   R25 -- port the renderers; do NOT shell out to `swil.sh login`. That
#     command also authenticates and writes `.agent-state/active`, which the
#     concurrency model deliberately avoids (parallel rounds pin an account
#     with `SWIL_AGENT`), and it takes a POSITIONAL personality path rather
#     than honouring `SWIL_AGENT` at all.
#   R26 -- render the now-context IN MEMORY and write no file. One shared
#     file carrying a per-account line is a race under five-way parallelism,
#     and the frozen file naming exactly one account is what that race looks
#     like. `context/now.md` stays a Bash-only artifact, which keeps the
#     `SWIL_RUNTIME=bash` rollback working unchanged.
#   R27 -- `news_today.md` keeps its file and Python shells out to
#     `news-fetch.sh`. That script is a pure cache-filler (no auth, no
#     session state, idempotent, owns its own staleness and lock), shared by
#     23 readers; reimplementing it here would be a second writer racing the
#     first.
#   R28 -- the rendered TEXT stays byte-comparable to what Bash produced.
#     The drift experiment is in flight: a prompt whose wording moved on
#     2026-08-20 would put a second change point on top of the runtime
#     cutover and the two would be inseparable in the data. Only the
#     freshness of the content may change. `test_world_context.py` pins the
