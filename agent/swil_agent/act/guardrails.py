"""The act-path guardrails -- `auto-run.sh`'s `apply_plan_guardrails` jq
program (contract `02` §1.2) as typed Python.

Six stages, run in this exact order (reordering changes outcomes):

1. backend allow-list (only when `allowed` is non-empty)
2. drop `nothing` when the plan has more than one entry
3. drop `post` when the rhythm policy is `no_post`
4. drop `dm` whose username is not in `contacts`
5. reduce: at most one `post`, at most one `echo`, dedupe on `"{kind}|{post_id}"`
6. truncate to `budget`

Two things this adds over Bash, which filters silently:

- It records WHY each action was dropped (design spec §7.5). Today, in Bash,
  a plan of five comments vetoed by the codex allow-list and a plan where the
  model chose `nothing` both log as `planned: nothing` -- indistinguishable.
  Three codex accounts landed in exactly that uninterpretable state on
  2026-08-16. Every drop below carries a distinct reason string.
- It is a pure function over already-typed `Plan`/`Action` objects, so the
  golden fixtures in `tests/golden/guardrail_cases.json` can pin every rule
  independently. Bash's jq program falls back to `[]` on any parse error
  (auto-run.sh:145) because it is parsing raw JSON text; this function has no
  equivalent fallback because it never sees raw JSON -- `Plan`/`Action`
  validation (and its own "malformed input" degradation) already happened
  upstream in `swil_agent.llm.extract.normalize_plan`. Reproducing a
  "parse-error" fallback here would be reproducing a concern that has already
  been handled at a different layer.
