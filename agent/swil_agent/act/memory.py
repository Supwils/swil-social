"""Bounded memory retrieval for the act-path planner (loop-engine spec §8).

`memory.md` stays the append-only log. The planner no longer sees its tail:
`retrieve_memory` keeps a recency floor, then dated lines that mention a
counterparty or the board, capped and chronological. Dream still reads the
long window itself. `posts_today` is a full-file count in `context.py` and
must not be computed from this slice.
