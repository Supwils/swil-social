"""What an account actually posts, embedded and shipped to `/lab`.

Port of `agent/scripts/behavior-snapshot.sh` (frozen; that script, not any
prose about it, is the contract). It embeds the account's RECENT POSTS and
POSTs the vector; the SERVER computes persona fidelity =
cosine(personality, behavior) against the newest `personalitysnapshots` row
(`server/src/modules/agents/agents.drift.ts:228-237`). Nothing here computes
a similarity.

This is the "revealed self" half of `/lab`'s fidelity pair -- `snapshot.sh`
(ported in `dream/round.py`'s `build_snapshot_payload`) supplies the "stated
self". The two are DIFFERENT endpoints with DIFFERENT bodies and must not be
derived from one another:

  * `/agents/{u}/snapshots`           <- personality.md, 6 fields including
                                        `snapshotType` and `archivePath`
  * `/agents/{u}/behavior-snapshots`  <- recent posts, 6 DIFFERENT fields
                                        including `postCount`/`commentCount`
                                        and neither of those two

Fail-soft is a hard requirement, not a quality bar: `auto-run.sh:806` calls
this with `|| true` after every act cycle. No `api_key.txt`, no posts, a
dead platform, a dead embedder and a server rejection all return cleanly.
Only the two cases the script itself treats as caller error -- an account
directory that does not exist, and a `personality.md` with no `Username`
bullet -- are absent here, because this function takes `directory` and
`username` already resolved (same seam as `analysis/rule_check.py`), so its
caller owns them.

    language text, so the behavior vector is never polluted by the
    translation layer, which is the script's own stated reason (:57-58).

    Reproduces jq's `//`, which is NOT Python's `or`, and the difference is
    observable: jq falls back only when the left side is `null` or `false`,
    and an EMPTY STRING is truthy in jq. So an item with
    `originalText: ""` and `text: "hello"` yields `""` here -- which the
    blank filter then drops entirely -- where `originalText or text` would
    have embedded `"hello"`.

    This is deliberately NOT shared with `rule_check.extract_posts`, which
    ports a DIFFERENT script whose extraction is embedded Python
    (`rule-check.sh:59`, literally `it.get("originalText") or it.get("text")
    or ""`) and therefore genuinely does have `or` semantics. The two
    scripts disagree; unifying the ports would silently pick a winner.

    The blank filter is `(. | gsub("\\s";"")) != ""` -- removing every
    whitespace character and comparing to empty, which is true exactly when
    the string is not all-whitespace, i.e. `raw.strip() != ""`.

    A non-string body is dropped rather than raising. Bash would abort the
    whole jq pipeline on one (`gsub` on a number is an error), losing the
    entire sample to `|| echo ''`; dropping the one bad item keeps the other
    eleven measurable, and this module may never turn a surprising payload
