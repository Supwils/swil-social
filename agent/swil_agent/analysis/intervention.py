"""One human intervention, recorded as a first-class `/lab` event.

Three manual interventions happened during the drift experiment and none of
them appears in any `/lab` series, so every longitudinal read of that window
is wrong and looks fine:

  * `liushang`'s `personality.md` was hand-rolled back on 2026-08-05 for
    phrase fixation, bypassing the drift gate entirely -- the archive header
    (`归档于 2026-08-05 01:35:04，手工干预：短语固着回滚`) is the only trace.
  * ten entries were deleted from `liushang`'s `memory.md` at the same
    moment, which changes what every later dream prompt was built from.
  * `lvchuang`'s `personality.md` was rewritten out of band with NO archive
    entry, so no snapshot exists and `/lab` draws a flat drift line through
    a stretch where the document actually moved.

**This module is the one member of `analysis/` that is never called from a
round.** Its siblings are fail-soft by contract because Bash calls them with
`|| true` inside a cycle. This one is operator-driven, runs once, by hand,
and is deliberately LOUD: nothing retries it, nothing else notices, and a
silently-dropped record leaves the analysis it exists to correct exactly as
wrong as it was. `Resources.record_intervention` (not `lab_event`) is what
carries that difference onto the wire.

**Everything on the wire is built here, from scalars.** `metrics` is a
`z.record(z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean(), z.null()]))`
(`agents.schemas.ts`) -- flat only, and a nested object or array 400s the
WHOLE event, which is the defect that ran six weeks undetected. The caller
never hands in a mapping: it passes typed scalar arguments and this module
assembles the dict, so a nested value is not something an operator can
express at 2am. That is the design point of the whole module -- the guard is
the absence of the footgun, not a check that catches it.

    without an offset, and zod's `z.coerce.date()` resolves that in the
    SERVER's timezone -- so a stamp copied out of a local `date` line would
    land seven hours from where it belongs, which is small enough to still
    look like a plausible timestamp.
