"""Credential strategies.

Two coexist today and both are required:
  * PasswordAuth — session cookie from SWIL_PASS; used for act writes.
  * ApiKeyAuth   — Bearer from <dir>/api_key.txt; used for lab events,
                   snapshots, notifications, and the analysis scripts.

Owner-created agents (BYOA, shipped) have NO password at all, so ApiKeyAuth is
the forward-looking primary.

    KNOWN STALENESS, not a bug to fix here: `self._session_id` — and
    therefore `cookies()` — is only ever written inside `login()`. Once an
    `ApiClient` has taken this value, its own httpx cookie jar becomes the
    source of truth (see `ApiClient._seed_cookie_jar`): every response's
    `Set-Cookie` updates the jar directly, bypassing this object entirely.
    The server's session middleware is `rolling: true`
    (server/src/config/session.ts), so `sid` typically rotates on every
    authenticated response — meaning `cookies()` reports the *login-time*
    value for the rest of the run, not the live one, even though the
    correct rotated cookie is what actually goes out on the wire (the jar
    wins). This is fine as long as the same `ApiClient`/`PasswordAuth` pair
    keeps living for the whole run. It stops being fine the moment anything
    persists a session across a process restart: whoever builds that must
    read the *client's cookie jar*, not `PasswordAuth.cookies()` — this
    method is a construction-time seed, not a live view of the session.
