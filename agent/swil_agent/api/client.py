"""HTTP transport for the Swil API.

Differences from `swil.sh` that are the point of this module:
  * Error bodies are preserved on ApiError instead of being sent to
    /dev/null — `swil.sh`'s `_curl` pipes curl's stderr through
    `2>/dev/null`, so a "HTTP 400: Invalid id" validation error is invisible
    in `agent/logs/auto-run.log`. Real runs have logged apparent success for
    writes that never happened because of exactly this.
  * Non-2xx raises; it never silently returns a body that could be mistaken
    for success. A 2xx response with an unparseable or non-object body also
    raises, for the same reason: better a loud ApiError than a caller trying
    to index into `None` or a list.
  * A raw httpx exception is never allowed to escape `_send` either — a
    connection failure or timeout is wrapped into `TransportError`, an
    `ApiError` subclass, matching the contract `api/images.py` already
    documents for itself. Retries are deliberately NOT implemented here:
    spec §5.4 assigns retry policy to LangGraph's per-node `RetryPolicy` in
    Plan 2, and a retry loop at this layer too would double up.

    `CookieJar.extract_cookies`, which resolves a host-only cookie's storage
    domain via `http.cookiejar.eff_request_host`. Calling that exact stdlib
    function here — rather than reimplementing RFC 2965's domain rule by
    hand — keeps this in lockstep with whatever CPython's cookiejar actually
    does, including host classes (IPv4 literals, in particular) it already
    special-cases.

    The rule this makes visible: cookiejar treats a bare hostname with no
    dot (`localhost`, any bare intranet name) as needing a synthetic
    `.local` suffix, so it isn't accidentally domain-matched as a TLD-less
    name; a dotted hostname or an IPv4 literal (which always contains dots)

        This exists for exactly one flow: `PasswordAuth` restored from a
        prior run via a caller-supplied `session_id`, which has no
        `Set-Cookie` response for httpx to auto-capture. Fresh logins need
        no seed at all — `auth.cookies()` is `{}` until `login()` runs, and
        from that point on httpx.Client already extracts every response's
        `Set-Cookie` into this same jar, which is the entire reason to use
        one long-lived `Client` per session.

        After this one-time seed, `_send()` never touches cookies again.
        An earlier version instead compared `auth.cookies()` against the jar
        on *every* request and rewrote the jar on any mismatch. That was
        wrong in both directions once the session middleware started
        rotating `sid` on every response (`rolling: true`,
        server/src/config/session.ts): the jar had the live value, the
        comparison found it "different" from the stale snapshot in `auth`,
        and wrote the stale value back — producing a duplicate `sid` cookie
        that on the *next* comparison made `httpx.Cookies.get()` raise
        `CookieConflict`, crashing every request from then on. The jar is
        the only thing that stays current post-login; nothing should ever
        write over it again.

        Seeding with an explicit domain (rather than the domain-less default
        `Cookies.set()` would otherwise use, which matches *any* host and
        reintroduces the duplicate the moment httpx auto-captures a real,
        host-qualified `Set-Cookie`) matters, and it has to be the *correct*
        domain: an even earlier version used the literal hostname
        (`self._client.base_url.host`), which is wrong for any dotless host
        — `http://localhost:8899` in particular, this project's own
        documented local-dev default — because `http.cookiejar` stores
        `Set-Cookie` from a dotless host under a synthetic `<host>.local`
        key, not the bare host. A seed seeking `domain="localhost"` and a
        real capture landing at `domain="localhost.local"` never collide,
        so the seeded cookie silently never matches an outgoing request and
        is never sent again — exactly the invisible-failure class this
        module exists to eliminate. `_effective_cookie_domain()` replicates
        cookiejar's own normalization so the seeded jar key is identical to
        the one a same-host `Set-Cookie` will use, so a later rotation
        *replaces* this entry in place instead of adding a second one next
        to it, for dotted hosts, IPv4 literals, and dotless hosts alike.
