"""Wire-format DTOs for the API boundary.

Unlike `models.py` (snake_case, domain-shaped, wire-format-agnostic by
contract — see that module's docstring), types here exist *only* to be
serialized onto the wire and therefore own the snake_case -> camelCase
conversion themselves. They carry no domain meaning of their own; nothing
outside `api/` should ever need to construct or inspect one.

    `occurred_at` is the one field no live-runtime emitter sets: every event
    a round files happens now, and `agent_events.created_at` already defaults

    intervention recorded weeks later — because every `/lab` read of that

    its own instant annotates the wrong stretch of the series.
