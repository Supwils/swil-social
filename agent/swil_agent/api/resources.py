"""Typed endpoint methods with write verification.

Every create reads the server-assigned id back out of the response and raises
`WriteNotVerifiedError` if it is absent. `swil.sh` did not do this: `like`
piped the response straight to `jq .` and inspected nothing (its reported
exit status was `jq`'s, not curl's — see agent/scripts/swil.sh line 503), and
`comment` extracted `.data.comment.id` only to write a log line, never
failing when it was empty (line 494). That is why codex accounts could log
DONE for writes that never landed, and why codex is currently restricted to
post/nothing by a guardrail allow-list.

Response shapes below were read out of `server/src/` directly (not assumed
from the task brief, which guessed wrong on `send_dm` and on the create_post
multipart field name) and are cited with file:line evidence in each method's
docstring.

        `echo_of` added in Task 6 (act/executor.py): the brief for that task
        called `create_post(text, echo_of=post_id)` for the `echo` kind, but
        this method had no such parameter at the time — Task 1's brief never
        mentioned echo at all. A repost is, server-side, just a normal post
        with `echoOf` set (`posts.schemas.ts`'s `createPostSchema.echoOf`,
        a 24-hex-char id, optional), routed through the exact same
        `POST /posts` handler and the exact same `{"data": {"post": {...}}}`
        response shape — so this is a same-endpoint extension, not a new
        method. One behavior worth flagging for whoever calls this next:
        `posts.write.ts:27` (`if (input.echoOf && !input.text.trim()) throw
        AppError.validation('An echo must include your commentary')`) means
        a quote-less repost (`echo_of` set, `text` empty) 400s server-side —
        contrary to contract `02` §2.5's claim that bash's quote-less echo
        (`{"echoOf": "$ECHO_ID"}`, no `text` key) degrades to a plain
        repost. It doesn't: swil.sh sends the same wire shape this method
        does (see the `if text:` guard below — a quote-less call omits the
        `text` key entirely, byte for byte matching swil.sh:602-617's
        `else BODY='{"echoOf":...}'` branch, not merely an
        empty-string-that-normalises-the-same approximation of it) and
        would hit the same validation error. That mismatch predates this
        migration (the check has been in `posts.write.ts` since 2026-04-26,
        commit `c7ab7e3`) and reproducing swil.sh's literal request shape
        here is the correct port regardless — a caller that wants a real
        quote-less repost to land needs a non-empty `text`, which is a
        product-level gap in swil.sh itself, not something to paper over
        silently in this client. Note the two shapes were already
        behaviourally identical even before the `if text:` guard existed
        (`posts.schemas.ts:6`'s `text: z.string().trim().max(5000).default
        ('')` normalises an absent key and an explicit `""` to the exact
        same server-side value), so this is a wire-shape fidelity fix, not
        a behavior fix — the 400 fired either way.

        wraps that as `ok(res, out)`

        verification of the state, not a formality — a response that
        parses as JSON but omits or falsifies `liked` (e.g. a
        proxy/middleware swallowing the write) is exactly the silent

        `follows.controller.ts`'s `follow` handler calls
        `return noContent(res)` (server/src/modules/follows/
        follows.controller.ts:7-11), and `noContent` is
        `res.status(204).end()` (server/src/lib/respond.ts:10-12) — a bare
        204 with an empty body. `ApiClient.post()` would raise `ApiError`
        trying to `.json()`-parse that empty body (see
        `ApiClient._payload`), so this uses `raw_post` and verifies the
        status code directly instead.

        "Already following" is a real, distinct server response:
        `follows.service.ts`'s `follow()` does `if (!edge) throw
        AppError.conflict('Already following this user')` on the no-op insert
        (server/src/modules/follows/follows.service.ts:28-34), which is a
        409 with body `{"error": {"code": "CONFLICT", ...}}`
        (`AppError.conflict` -> status 409 code 'CONFLICT',
        server/src/lib/errors.ts:32-34; serialized by
        server/src/middlewares/errorHandler.ts:21-28).

        THAT 409 IS RAISED, NOT SWALLOWED (ruling R20). This method used to
        `return` on `exc.code == "CONFLICT"`, on the reasoning that "the end
        state is identical whether this call or an earlier one created the
        edge, so treating CONFLICT as success matches the Bash contract".
        Both halves of that were wrong, and the second one is what made the
        defect look intentional for three review rounds:

          * The claim that "swil.sh's `_curl … | jq .` pipeline never
            inspected `_curl`'s exit status" is FALSE. `swil.sh` runs under
            `set -euo pipefail` (swil.sh:29) and `_curl` returns 1 for any
            status >= 400 (swil.sh:132-135), so the pipeline fails, the case
            aborts, and `swil.sh follow` exits NON-ZERO on a 409. Verified by
            repro, not by reading.
          * So Bash does not treat "already following" as success anywhere
            except the round TALLY. `auto-run.sh:243-252` takes its `else`
            branch: `WARN <name> follow @<user> failed (likely already
            following)` and a `warn` lab event -- then `return 0`, because
            "already following" is not a failed ROUND. And one level down,
            `_remember` is never reached, so no `memory.md` line is written.

        Swallowing it here made all three of those wrong at once (a `DONE`
        log line, a `success` lab event mislabelling the case in `/lab`, and
        a memory line Bash never writes -- which is the dream's input and the
        unit `DREAM_MIN_NEW_MEMORIES=8` counts). Raising is also the only
        shape that cannot be ignored silently by a caller: a returned flag
        can be dropped on the floor, which is exactly how this survived.

        `act/executor.py`'s `_execute_follow` distinguishes this CONFLICT
        from every other write failure (loop-engine spec §6): 409 /
        `CONFLICT` is `landed=True`, `call_succeeded=False` (idempotent
        success, no memory line); any other `ApiError` /
        `WriteNotVerifiedError` is `landed=False`.

        There is no `/messages` route at all. Direct messages go through a

        messages.routes.ts, mounted at `/api/v1/conversations` in
        server/src/app.ts:164). The two-call shape below is derived from
        that server source, which is what this checkout actually contains
        and what a reader here can verify. It is additionally corroborated
        by a `dm` case in `swil.sh` doing the same find-or-create-then-send
        two calls — but that case is UNCOMMITTED at the time of writing and
        therefore absent from this repository's checked-out `swil.sh`; it
        exists only in one working tree elsewhere, so no line numbers are
        cited for it here.

          1. `POST /conversations` with `{"recipientUsername": username}`
             -> `{"data": {"conversation": {"id": ...}}}`, 201 if a new
             conversation was created, 200 if one already existed
             (messages.routes.ts:37-54,
             `return ok(res, { conversation: dto }, created ? 201 : 200)`).

             `return ok(res, { message: dto }, 201)`).

        Both steps are independently id-verified; a conversation created
        with no id is just as much a silent-failure shape as a message sent
        with no id, so both raise `WriteNotVerifiedError` rather than only
        checking the final step.

        message id (fix round 1, task-7 review item 4) so a caller can
        record `conversationId` the way `swil.sh`'s own `_remember "dm |
        to=$RECIPIENT conversationId=$CONV_ID | ..."` does (swil.sh:711).
