"""CLI entrypoints, argument-compatible with the Bash scripts where they overlap.

Exit codes are deliberately the Bash ones (66 = no such account, 75 = no
action ran) so `cycle-one.sh` and the heartbeat can invoke either runtime
during the canary without knowing which they got. `ActOutcome`/`DreamResult`
are the internal representation; the process exit code is the external
contract (task-13-brief.md).

Mapping, by command:

  * `act`  -- `ActResult.grants_dream` (design spec §7.1) IS the exit-code
    decision: `True` (landed, partial, vetoed-empty, planner-empty -- every
    outcome except a dead backend or an unreachable platform) exits 0,
    `False` exits 75. This is deliberate and NOT a byte-for-byte replay of
    Bash's own rc=75, which also fires on a rhythm-vetoed or deliberately
    empty plan (`auto-run.sh`'s own comment: "节律否决" is one of the
    non-zero causes) -- that conflation is exactly the bug `grants_dream`
    exists to fix (CLAUDE.md, "Empty plan counts as failure"). A caller that
    branches on this exit code to decide whether to run `dream` next
    (mirroring `cycle-one.sh`'s own `if auto-run.sh; then dream.sh; fi`)
    gets the CORRECTED decision, which is the point of shipping the fix at
    all.
  * `dream` -- `DreamResult.proceeded` is the exit-code decision:
    `False` (a cooldown SKIP -- the LLM was never even called) exits 75,
    matching "no action ran"; `True` (the dream ran to a verdict, whether
    accepted, structurally rejected, or drift-rejected) exits 0, matching
    "something ran". `dream.sh` itself has no consumer of its own exit code
    (`cycle-one.sh` calls it unconditionally, without an `if`), so this
    mapping is this module's own decision, chosen to mirror `act`'s
    "attempted vs never-attempted" shape rather than invent a third scheme.
  * Everything else -- ANY exception, not an enumerated list of them --
    also exits 75, via ONE broad guard wrapping composition-plus-run in each
    command (fix round 2, task-13-report.md). The invariant is "no setup
    failure may leave the 0/66/75 contract", not "these particular
    exceptions": `cycle-one.sh` and the heartbeat branch on those three
    codes, and a raw traceback/exit 1 is a fourth code neither knows how to
    read. `_skip_for_exception` draws exactly one distinction inside that
    guard, because collapsing it away would be worse than the bug it fixes:

      - `AccountSetupError` (raised only by this module's own composition
        helpers, at the exact point each one knows both the cause and the
        remedy: `_resources_for` for no credentials or a failed
        `PasswordAuth.login()`, `_backend_for` for a dead backend key,
        `_load_persona_or_raise_setup_error` for a personality.md that
        exists but won't parse) and `LockBusy` are KNOWN, remediable setup
        problems -- not bugs. Their own message (already a complete "cause
        -- remedy" sentence) becomes the SKIP line verbatim.
      - Anything else is, by definition, NOT one of those -- a genuine
        programming error. Logged as `UNEXPECTED <ExceptionType>: <message>`
        (never disguised as a setup problem someone could fix by running
        `create-api-key`) with its traceback at DEBUG, so it is recoverable
        by whoever is looking without being the operator's primary output.

This module is the ONLY composition root in the package: the one place
allowed to import every layer (`api/`, `llm/`, `embedder/`, `persona/`,
`act/`, `dream/`) at once and wire concrete collaborators together from a
`Settings` instance and an account name. Every module below it stays
unit-testable in isolation because none of them constructs its own
collaborators -- see `act/round.py`'s and `dream/round.py`'s own module
docstrings for the same argument from their side of the seam.

The small `_..._for(...)` builder functions below exist so CLI tests can
replace exactly one layer at a time (e.g. monkeypatch `_resources_for` to
return a `FakeResources()` double) without needing to fake Typer's argument
parsing or reach into `swil_agent.api`/`swil_agent.llm` internals from the
test module. `tests/unit/test_cli.py` monkeypatches every network- and
subprocess-facing one of these for its `CliRunner` tests, and calls several
of them directly (over `httpx.MockTransport`) so they are not *only* ever
exercised through a monkeypatched stand-in for themselves.

    **The filename is PER COMMAND, and getting it wrong is silent.** The two
    scripts write to two different files and always have:
    `auto-run.sh:31-34` sets `LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/auto-run.log"`, while
    `dream.sh:36-40` sets `LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/dream.log"` -- both live, both
    written on the same day in the main checkout (auto-run.log 1.0MB,
    dream.log 234KB). An earlier version of this function hardcoded
    `auto-run.log` for BOTH commands (ruling R20), so Python dreams appended
    dream verdicts into the act log while `dream.log` stayed empty: anyone
    grepping `dream.log` for a Python round's verdict found nothing, and
    anyone counting act lines in `auto-run.log` counted dream lines too.
    Hence `ACT_LOG_FILENAME`/`DREAM_LOG_FILENAME` as named constants passed
    explicitly, rather than a default this function could quietly apply to
    the wrong caller.

    `_log` itself (auto-run.sh:41-45, byte-identical in dream.sh) is
    `msg="[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $*"`, echoed to stdout AND appended
    to `$LOG_FILE`, with `LOG_DIR="$ROOT_DIR/logs"` and `ROOT_DIR` = `agent/`
    (both scripts `mkdir -p` it). Same path, same timestamp format, same
    append semantics, and the formatter carries NO level name -- so a Python
    round's line is byte-comparable with the Bash one that a straggler
    reconciliation or a post-run QA pass greps for. Without this, 17 computed
    `ExecutionOutcome.log_line` values went nowhere and a Python round left
    both files untouched, which reads exactly like a round that never ran.

    `basicConfig`'s stderr stream is untouched and keeps its
    `%(levelname)s %(message)s` shape. The one cosmetic difference from Bash
    is that its second copy goes to stdout, not stderr.

    Attached to the `swil_agent` logger, NOT the root: the root would also
    capture `httpx`'s own INFO-level "HTTP Request: ..." line for every API
    call, which `auto-run.log` has never contained.

    At most ONE round-log ATTACHMENT exists at a time (one handler for
    `act`/`dream`, two for `cycle`). Re-attaching the same one is a no-op (a
    `CliRunner`-driven test invokes the app many times in one process, and a
    second handler would double every line); attaching a DIFFERENT one --
    including the other command's -- closes and replaces the previous
    attachment rather than accumulating open files across a session.

    the lock costs a concurrent real Bash round its whole turn (F4). It also
    does not dream: `write_step`/`snapshot_step` have no `dry_run` to be inert
    under, so `graph/cycle.py` routes a dry cycle from the act phase straight
    to logout (design spec §9.4, "executes nothing and writes nothing").

    **`--resume`** continues the last checkpointed cycle for this account,
    reusing its `thread_id`. The round id is read back out of the checkpoint
    database (`latest_round_id`) rather than recomputed from the clock, which
    would produce a different thread and silently start a fresh cycle.

#
# The four SAMPLERS -- `rule-check`, `behavior-snapshot`, `population-metric`,
# `summary` -- are OBSERVABILITY, never the main flow, and their exit codes
# say so: `0` whenever the command ran, whatever it found. Bash swallows every
# one of these at its call site (`auto-run.sh:806`, `cycle-one.sh:45`) or
# runs it as a standalone daily job, and a measurement outage -- no api_key,
# no parseable rule, a dead embedder, an unreachable platform -- is never a
# round failure. `75` is reserved for the SETUP failures that mean nothing
# was measured at all, and `66` for an account that does not exist.
#
# `intervention` (`:1533`) lives in this section and does NOT follow that
# rule, deliberately. It is a WRITE that nothing retries and nothing else
# notices, so it exits 75 on a server rejection rather than 0. Do not
# "correct" it to match its neighbours: the swallowed 400 is the exact
# six-week defect this command was written to end.
#
# `rule-check`, `behavior-snapshot` and `population-metric` are ALSO wired
# into `cycle` (`graph/nodes.py`); these commands exist for the same reason
# `dream.sh`
# exists next to `cycle-one.sh` -- re-sampling one account by hand without
# spending a round on it, and covering anyone still driving the act phase
# with `swil-agent act`, which (like the frozen `run_act` it wraps) does not
# sample.

    every mechanism that would otherwise leave a trace -- the archive, the
    drift gate, the snapshot upload -- so the `/lab` series that covers it
    goes on looking normal while being wrong. This is how that stops being
    invisible.

    Optimised for "impossible to do wrong at 2am" rather than for keystrokes,
    and every one of the five required options is a failure that has already
    happened here:

      * `--at` has NO default. "Now" is almost never when an intervention
        happened, and a silent default would put the marker at the far end of
        the series from the stretch it annotates -- which is the same as not
        recording it.
      * `--dated-from` is required because a commit date and an archive
        header are not the same kind of fact. One is an upper bound on an
        edit that happened at some unknown earlier moment; the other is a
        second-accurate observation. Recorded separately so nobody later
        reads a bound as a measurement.
      * `--evidence` is required because an intervention record nobody can
        check against a header, a commit or a note is a rumour in the one
        series whose job is to make the data auditable.
      * `metrics` is assembled from these scalars and is never accepted as a
        mapping: a nested value 400s the whole event and both runtimes
        swallow it, which is exactly how that defect ran six weeks unnoticed.
      * The write is VERIFIED, not fire-and-forget. `Resources.lab_event`
        swallows every `ApiError`; this path uses `record_intervention`,
        which raises, so a 403 (wrong account's credential) or a 400
        (rejected body) exits 75 with the server's own message instead of
        printing a success line.

    No round log is attached, unlike every other command here: this is not a
    round, and `auto-run.log`'s line counts are read as act-round counts
    during straggler reconciliation. The durable record is the lab event.

    Exit codes: `66` no such account, `75` anything that stopped the record
    from landing (bad timestamp, over-length field, setup failure, server
    rejection), `0` recorded.
