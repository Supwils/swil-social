"""Compose the whole dream path: cooldown, candidate generation, the gate,
and -- when accepted -- the write sequence that archives the old
personality, writes the new one, updates the cooldown markers, and uploads
a snapshot.

Source of truth is `agent/scripts/dream.sh` (read directly; see `dream/
candidate.py`'s and `dream/gate.py`'s module docstrings for why the contract
docs alone are not trusted here) and `agent/scripts/snapshot.sh` for
`build_snapshot_payload` -- both read line-by-line while writing this module,
not assumed from the contract doc's transcription.

WRITE ORDERING IS THE CONTRACT (contract `03` §4, `dream.sh:828-882`), and it
is the reason steps 1-6 below live INSIDE `write_step` rather than being six
separately callable pieces a caller sequences for itself (step 7 is
`snapshot_step`, deliberately outside that atomic group -- see its own
docstring for why a failure there is a WARN, not a rollback):

  1. diff narrative                 -- computed FIRST, using `original` and
                                        `candidate` as the two in-memory
                                        strings they already are at this
                                        point (equivalently: while
                                        personality.md on disk still holds
                                        the OLD text)
  2. archive prepend                -- `persona_source.archive_and_write`
  3. personality.md write              bundles this pair into ONE call, in
                                        that internal order (temp-file swap;
                                        see `persona/source.py`)
  4. `last_dream_<name>` marker      -- `state.record_dream` bundles this
  5. `last_dream_memlines_<name>`       pair into ONE call, in that internal
     marker                             order (`dream/candidate.py`'s
                                        `FilesystemDreamState.record_dream`)
  6. memory.md append                -- AFTER step 5, so the housekeeping
                                        line self-counts toward the NEXT
                                        round's cooldown-override tally
                                        (deliberate; do not reorder --
                                        contract `03` §1.3/§4)
  7. snapshot upload                 -- after personality.md is already
                                        live; a failure here is a WARN and
                                        does NOT roll back the write already
                                        committed in steps 2-3

Two collaborators each bundle two of Bash's seven numbered steps into one
call because they already carry their own correctness invariant about the
pair's internal order (an atomic temp-file swap; two related on-disk
markers) -- see their own docstrings. `write_step`'s job is the ordering
BETWEEN those bundles, not within them. `run_dream`'s own job is the
ordering between the five STEPS (`cooldown_step`, `dream_step`, `gate_step`,
`write_step`, `snapshot_step` -- each separately callable so Task 7's graph
nodes drive the same implementations this path does, ruling R4), and
guarding the whole sequence with
`FileLock(dream_lock_path(...))` so a held lock raises `LockBusy` OUT of this
function (ruling R6) rather than being folded into `DreamResult` -- the
lock's release-on-exception behaviour (a plain `with` block) is what stops
the accepted-dream orphan lock: under Bash, every accepted dream exits 141
right after "snapshot uploaded" (a SIGPIPE inside the echo-chamber detector,
see CLAUDE.md), and because that happens AFTER the `trap ... RETURN EXIT`
line already ran, the lock is still released there -- but a Python exception
anywhere in this sequence, before this function returns, releases the lock
the same way a normal return does, which is the actual fix for that class of
defect once this runtime is live.

Lab-event posting (`_post_agent_event` calls in dream.sh -- 15 call sites
across the dream path) IS implemented, via `_emit` below: `dream/dream`
started/fail/warn/success and `snapshot/snapshot` success/warn, matching
Bash's own summary strings exactly (fix round 1, item 1 -- an initial
version of this module deferred this, reasoning that the seven-step WRITE
ordering contract has no lab-event step in it; the coordinator's counter was
that Python's act path already emits 5 events through `act/executor.py`,
so a silent dream path is an inconsistency within this one plan, not a
deferral, and spec §10 stage 4's cutover criterion -- "every canary dream
terminates with a recorded verdict" -- is written against `/lab`, not a
local log line). `_emit` never lets an events outage change what this
function returns -- see its own docstring -- mirroring `Resources.lab_event`
's existing `except ApiError: return` guarantee with a second, broader net.

Two lab-event details this module does NOT attempt: Bash's per-check
summary/reason SPLIT for structural failures (six different validators, each
putting the dynamic part in a different one of `summary`/`reason` --
`persona/validators.py`'s `ValidationFailure.detail` already gives one
combined string, which every reject event's `summary` carries whole rather
than being pulled apart again here), and the two `echo_flag` events
(`echo/cleared`, `echo/flagged`) -- the first is unreachable without the
second, which is the write side of echo-chamber detection this module does
not implement (see below).

Deliberately NOT implemented here, consistent with CLAUDE.md's own framing
of the feature as "OFF by default" and uncalibrated:

  * Echo-chamber DETECTION -- the write side of contract `03` §4.10
    (embedding an account's last 12 posts, computing pairwise variance,
    writing a NEW `echo_flag_<name>`). `settings.echo_detect` defaults to
    `False` and must not become `True` in this plan (its threshold is
    uncalibrated: measured variance 0.001-0.011 against a shipped 0.04
    would flag every account on every dream, confounding the topic aspect
    of the in-flight drift experiment). Since the feature is inert by
    construction whenever it stays off, and no test in this task's brief
    exercises it, this module wires only the unconditional READ-and-consume
    side (`dream.candidate.read_echo_hint`, called every dream regardless
    of `ECHO_DETECT` -- Bash's own read is not gated either, only the
    write/detection block at the bottom of `dream_one` is). Implementing
    the write side is left to whichever later task actually calibrates
    `ECHO_VARIANCE_THRESHOLD`, so turning it on is a one-place change
    instead of an already-half-built feature nobody remembers is there.
  * `EmbedderGuard.up()`/`.down()` and the "probe `EmbedderClient.health()`
    once per ROUND, not once per dream" ruling (forward requirement to
    tasks 12 AND 13, `progress.md`). Reading `dream.sh` directly confirms
    it never calls `embedder-guard.sh` itself -- `cycle-one.sh` brackets
    ONE ACCOUNT'S act+dream pair with `up`/`down`, and a full ROUND is many
    `cycle-one.sh` processes sharing that ref-counted guard, so "once per
    round" can only mean "once across many `run_dream` calls for different
    accounts", i.e. a concern that belongs to whatever composes multiple
    calls to this function (task 13's CLI), never to a single one of them.
    Nothing here calls the guard or probes embedder health.

    events that are the only external record of what it measured and what
    it decided: ONE always, and at most TWO in any single call.

    PURE with respect to the account's files: nothing here writes anything
    (the candidate lives in memory, not in a temp file as under Bash), which
    is what makes it safe for a Task 7 node to run before any write node
    exists.

    Three events are DEFINED here and at most two FIRE: the measurement is
    unconditional, and `warn` requires `accepted` while `fail` requires the
    negation, so they are mutually exclusive by construction. All of them
    belong to this step because all of them describe the GATE, not the
    round:

      * `success` + `summary="drift measured"` -- ALWAYS, whatever the
        verdict, including a structural rejection that never reached an
        embed. This is the calibration series (Phase B task 1, spec §8.1):
        before it, a dream contributed a data point only by being
        ACCEPTED, so the recorded distribution described the gate's own
        survivors. Emitted from HERE, not from `run_dream`, because
        `run_dream` is not the only caller -- `graph/nodes.py`'s gate node
        calls this function directly and is the deployed runtime since the
        Stage-5 cutover, so a measurement posted by the composition would
        be missing from every real round.
      * `warn` -- accepted, but `embedder_unreachable`: the drift check
        could not run at all and the dream landed UNGATED. Losing this
        event is worse than the outage it reports, since a fail-open is
        otherwise indistinguishable from a healthy accept.
      * `fail` + `_drift_fail_metrics` -- rejected. `run_dream` no longer
        needs to know how to spell either.

    The measurement event is posted FIRST, before the verdict's own event,
    so a timeline read top-down shows the numbers and then what was decided
    with them. It is a separate event rather than extra keys on the
    verdict's event for two reasons: a structural rejection and an accepted
    dream have no event in common to hang it on, and `agentEventIngest`
    caps `metrics` at flat scalars (see `_drift_metrics`), which the
    existing rejection payload already violates.

    The reason a caller must NOT re-derive the accept decision from
    `verdict.reason`: `dream/gate.py` COMPOSES that string, and in the
    deployed `DRIFT_MODE=aspect` a non-empty `aspect_note` prefix is
    routine. The typed fields (`accepted`, `embedder_unreachable`) are the
    contract; the text is for operators.

    `persona.raw` is the ORIGINAL side of every comparison -- the text the
    prompt was built from, not a fresh read of `personality.md`. Re-reading
    would compare the candidate against whatever is on disk NOW, which for a
    concurrent Bash round is a different document.

    the two pieces (echo-chamber detection's write side, embedder-guard
    probing) deliberately left to a later task.

    Sequence, as the five separately-callable steps this function is now
    the composition of:

      1. Acquire `FileLock(dream_lock_path(agent_root, name))` around
         EVERYTHING. Ruling R6: a held lock raises `LockBusy` OUT of this
         function -- "there was no round at all" is a different question
         from "what did this round decide", and `DreamResult` only answers
         the second. A plain `with` block is also the fix for the orphan
         dream lock: any exception between here and the return releases it,
         where Bash's accepted dreams exit 141 and leak theirs.
      2. `cooldown_step` -- the one `memory.md` read, its line count, and
         the auto-mode cooldown gate. `proceed=False` returns
         `proceeded=False` with nothing else populated.
      3. `dream_step` -- the `started` event, the four prompt blocks, the
         rewrite call. A `failure_reason` (only ever "LLM returned empty")
         returns `proceeded=True, accepted=False`.
      4. `gate_step` -- validators + drift, the calibration measurement
         it records on every path, and the gate's own events: the
         `drift measured` one ALWAYS, plus at most one of `warn`
         (accepted but ungated) / `fail` (rejected).
      5. `write_step` -- steps 1-6 of the write contract, gated on
         `verdict.accepted` INSIDE the step.
      6. `snapshot_step` -- step 7, gated on `written` INSIDE the step.
      7. Assemble the `DreamResult`.

    The gate's rejection is NOT an early return above steps 5-6: `verdict`
    and `written` are THREADED into them and this function branches on the
    `written` flag that comes back. Both spellings produce the identical
    `DreamResult` -- a rejected `write_step` is `(False, "")` and a skipped
    `snapshot_step` is `(False, None)`, which are `DreamResult`'s own
    defaults for a round that wrote nothing -- but only this one puts each
    guard where its write is. That matters because `run_dream` is not the
    only caller: Task 7's graph nodes call these same functions, and an
    unconditional edge out of a gate node would otherwise land a rejected
    candidate on disk and publish a snapshot of a personality that never
    existed. This is the same shape `run_act` uses for `dry_run`
    (`act/round.py`), and for the same reason (ruling R4): a block of logic
    that exists only inside the composition is a block the graph has to
    copy, and a copy is free to drift.

    Account/file resolution (`dir` not found, no `personality.md`, no
    `memory.md` -- contract `03` §1.2) is NOT this function's job:
    `persona: Persona` arriving here already implies a successful
    `load_persona`, mirroring `run_act`'s own `persona: Persona` parameter
    (task 7, `act/round.py`). The caller (the CLI, task 13) is where "no
    such account" becomes an exit code.

    `now` is a naive local wall-clock moment, matching the convention
    `GitPersonaSource.archive_and_write`'s own `when: datetime` parameter
    already established (`test_persona_source.py` drives it with plain
    `datetime(...)` literals, no tzinfo) -- it feeds the archive stamp, the
    memory.md date line, and (via `int(now.timestamp())`) the epoch marker,
    exactly the three things Bash's own (local-time) `date` calls feed.
    `captured_at` is the SEPARATE UTC moment the snapshot's `capturedAt`
    field needs -- Bash reads these from two independent `date`/`date -u`
    invocations too, so two independently-suppliable parameters here is
    more faithful than deriving one from the other via an environment-
    dependent timezone conversion.
