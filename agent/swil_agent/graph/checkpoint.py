"""SQLite checkpointer wiring: `CycleState` round-trips through LangGraph's
`SqliteSaver`, with every pydantic model reachable from it registered against
the msgpack serializer's allowlist.

Why registration is needed (measured behaviour, not speculation): a
`SqliteSaver` built with the library's own default serializer round-trips a
`CycleState` carrying a `Persona` today, but logs `Deserializing unregistered
type ... This will be blocked in a future version. Set
LANGGRAPH_STRICT_MSGPACK=true to block now, or add to allowed_msgpack_modules
to allow explicitly.` A pinned-version bump that flips that default to strict
would take resume out with no warning -- the whole point of persisting
`CycleState` is that a crashed cycle can restart from its last checkpoint,
and that path would go dark silently. Registering the types now, instead of
waiting for the upgrade to force the issue, is what this module does.

Where the DB file lives: `agent/.agent-state/`, the same directory Task 3's
`RunLease` / `FileLock` use for `lock_<name>` / `dream_lock_<name>` and that
`FilesystemDreamState` (`cli.py:382`) uses for its own state -- one directory
for every piece of "the Python runtime's local, per-account state" rather
than a new top-level directory per feature. `leases.py` itself takes a bare
`sqlite3.Connection` and does not choose a path (that call sits with a
future wiring task); the same is true here -- `open_checkpointer` takes a
full `db_path` rather than hardcoding one, so a caller is expected to pass
`settings.agent_root / ".agent-state" / CHECKPOINT_DB_NAME`, matching the
`FilesystemDreamState` pattern above. This module only owns the filename
(`CHECKPOINT_DB_NAME`), not the directory, so it stays trivially testable
against `tmp_path`.

The list of registered types is DERIVED from `CycleState`'s resolved type
hints, not hand-written: a hand-written list silently misses a field added
by a later task, and that is exactly the failure mode this module exists to
prevent. `typing.get_type_hints(CycleState)` is required rather than
`CycleState.__annotations__` -- with `from __future__ import annotations` in
`state.py`, `__annotations__` holds unresolved `ForwardRef`s
(`ForwardRef('Persona', module='swil_agent.graph.state')`), not classes.

Derivation walks two levels of nesting, not one: `CycleState`'s own fields
(`Persona`, `ActContext | None`, `Plan | None`, `list[VetoedAction]`,
`list[ActionResult]`, `AspectSims | None`, `DreamVerdict | None`, plus the
plain-value fields) are unwrapped first, then EVERY pydantic model found
that way has its own resolved fields unwrapped too, and so on until nothing
new turns up. That second level is what finds `Action` -- it is not a
`CycleState` annotation itself, only reachable through `Plan.actions`,
`VetoedAction.action`, and `ActionResult.action`. A single-level unwrap over
`CycleState` alone would miss it silently;
`test_the_derived_registration_covers_every_model_reachable_from_cycle_state`
(in the test module) pins the full closure so that regression cannot land
quietly.

One measured wrinkle, not obvious from the interface: as of Task 4, `Action`
never independently reached the msgpack allowlist check at runtime. The
serializer's pydantic-v2 branch calls `obj.model_dump()` before encoding,
which flattens `Plan.actions` / `VetoedAction.action` / `ActionResult.action`
into plain dicts BEFORE the ext-hook ever asks "is this type registered?" --
reconstruction of the nested `Action` happens through `Plan(**kwargs)`'s own
pydantic validation, not a second allowlist check. Verified directly:
round-tripping a `Plan` and a `VetoedAction` through a `JsonPlusSerializer`
allowlisted for `Plan`/`VetoedAction` but explicitly NOT `Action` reconstructs
both correctly. Task 4 recorded that registering it anyway was still correct
because "`Action` ever becoming a direct `CycleState` field" would change
that -- and Task 7's `actions: list[Action]` (the post-guardrail survivors
the `guardrail` node hands the `execute` node) is exactly that field, so the
registration is now load-bearing rather than merely harmless.

The same trap with the opposite outcome, measured on 2026-08-18: an
UNREGISTERED type is not merely warned about when an explicit
`allowed_msgpack_modules` is passed -- it is *blocked on load* and comes back
degraded. A `CycleState` carrying `ActOutcome.LANDED_ALL` and a
`RhythmDecision` through an allowlist missing both deserialized to the plain
`str` `'landed_all'` and a plain `dict`, with only a WARNING log to say so.
`ActOutcome` is a `StrEnum`, so every `==` and `in` comparison against it
still held and no test would have gone red. Hence `_discover_registered_types`
collects enums as well as models: a resumed cycle must get its own types back,
not string-shaped lookalikes that happen to compare equal today.
