"""Run leases -- a SQLite row that still holds the Bash-visible lock file.

Spec §7.3 says `lock_<name>` / `dream_lock_<name>` "become a row in SQLite
with a uniqueness constraint and a heartbeat timestamp". Read literally --
the row *replaces* the file -- that would silently destroy mutual exclusion
during migration stages 3 and 4, the exact window in which Bash and Python
run the same 23-account roster. A Bash round reads `.agent-state/lock_<name>`
and nothing else; it cannot see a SQLite row. Two runtimes, two disjoint
notions of "held", one account posting twice.

So a lease holds BOTH:

- the **file lock** (`swil_agent.locks.FileLock`, same paths, same 1800s
  staleness rule as auto-run.sh:406-433 and dream.sh:460-471) -- this is what
  makes exclusion *cross-runtime*;
- the **row** -- this is what makes a lease *expire*, and what carries the
  identity (`run_id`, `pid`) that a bare lock file cannot.

The file half is dropped at stage 5, when Bash no longer runs. Until then
removing it is not a simplification, it is a regression.

**What actually kills the orphan-lock class.** Time-based expiry alone buys
nothing over the file it accompanies: Bash already reclaims at the same 1800s
(auto-run.sh:423, dream.sh:466), so a dead run still costs the account up to
30 minutes of SKIPped rounds. The row carries the holder's **pid**, and a
lease whose pid is no longer alive is reclaimable *immediately*. That is the
difference between "we added SQLite" and "we killed the class of defect that
an accepted dream exiting 141 after `snapshot uploaded` used to create". Time
expiry stays as the backstop for a reused pid.

Pid liveness is only meaningful on the host that wrote the row. This runtime
is single-host by construction (the lease DB is a local SQLite file, and
SQLite over a network filesystem is unsound for other reasons), so no host
column is carried. If the DB ever becomes shared, `_pid_alive` must gain one.

Ordering is load-bearing: **file lock first, row second**. The file lock is
the cross-runtime authority, so the exclusion decision is made before any
claim is published; and if the row fails, the file lock is released. The
reverse order publishes a Python-side claim while the account still reads as
free to Bash, and any slip in its rollback strands a lock file -- invisible
to SQLite, and enough to make every later Bash round SKIP that account until
the staleness window runs out.

Release is **identity-scoped**, not key-scoped. A holder whose lease was
legitimately reclaimed while it was still running must not, on the way out,
delete the *successor's* row or unlink the successor's lock file -- which is
what a `WHERE (tenant, agent, kind)` delete and an unconditional unlink would
do, leaving the live successor holding neither half and nothing to tell it so.
Every write past acquisition therefore carries `run_id`, and the file half is
guarded by a random token this lease **wrote into** the lock file.

**Why a token in the file and not the inode number.** This guard used to
compare `st_ino`, on the stated assumption that a reclaim is unlink-then-create
and "the replacement gets a new inode". That is false, and not marginally:
ext4 hands a just-freed inode straight back to the next create, so on Linux
the successor's lock file routinely carries the predecessor's inode number and
the guard answers "still mine" about a file it does not own -- the exact ABA
hole it exists to close. APFS allocates file IDs from a monotonic counter
instead (measured on this repo's own volume: 300 unlink/create cycles at one
path, 300 distinct strictly-increasing ids), which is why the macOS dev
machine never saw this and why CI, the first time it ever ran this file on
Linux, failed both ABA tests immediately. **No `stat` field is a sound
identity**: `st_ino` and `st_dev` are recycled by design, and the timestamps
have filesystem-dependent granularity, so a create following an unlink within
the same tick is indistinguishable. Identity has to be something no later
file can be *handed*; a `uuid4` this process minted and wrote is that, and it
survives on disk exactly as long as the file it identifies. Cost: one small
read per heartbeat and one on release, in place of a `stat`.

A busy lease raises `LeaseBusy` immediately. There is deliberately no retry
loop: Bash logs `SKIP <name> -- locked` and moves on (auto-run.sh:424), and
waiting instead would change round scheduling.

**Concurrency on the SQLite file itself** (spec §15.1 row 23). Stage 3's
`--dry-run` shadow round never opened `run_leases.sqlite` -- a dry run takes
no lease -- so it never exercised what stage 4 does: 3-5 Python cycles, each
its own connection, sharing one file. `open_lease_db` sets `journal_mode=WAL`
and `busy_timeout` on that connection, once, at open, so a second writer
waits instead of raising `database is locked` on the spot. `heartbeat()`
still treats a locked database as a recoverable miss, not a reason to end the
cycle -- but logs it, because a heartbeat that fails silently and a heartbeat
that stops running are indistinguishable to Bash, which reclaims this lease's
file half after `LEASE_TTL_SECONDS` either way.
