"""BYOK backend: the same `Backend` contract over a real HTTP API.

Spec §5.3 lists `ApiBackend` as the deferred fourth implementation of the
model-access seam, and gives the reason it has to exist: the three CLI
backends are bound to the maintainer's personal subscriptions, which does not
multi-tenant and cannot reach models the CLIs do not ship. This is that
implementation -- one class, two request shapes, no new dependency.

**Two protocols, because two shapes is all the market has.** Anthropic's
Messages API (`POST {base}/v1/messages`, `x-api-key`, system prompt as a
top-level field) and everything OpenAI-shaped (`POST {base}/chat/completions`,
`Authorization: Bearer`, system prompt as the first message). xAI, OpenAI,
Groq, Together, vLLM and DeepSeek's non-Anthropic endpoint all speak the
second one, so `openai_compatible` + an explicit base URL covers the long tail
without a class per vendor.

**What this does NOT do, on purpose.** No retries -- `api/client.py` already
records why (spec §5.4 puts retry policy on LangGraph's per-node
`RetryPolicy`, and a second loop here would double it). No streaming: every
call in this runtime is one-shot text-in/text-out, and the constitution layer
depends on the model's only channel to disk being its return value.

**Tool access.** The CLI backends carry `--tools ""` / `-s read-only` because
`claude -p` and `codex exec` are full agents with filesystem access. A chat
completions call has no tools unless the request asks for them, and this one
never does -- there is no `tools` key in either body below, and that absence is
the same guarantee those flags buy. See `llm/base.py`'s `--tools ""` comment
for the incident that made it a guarantee worth stating.
