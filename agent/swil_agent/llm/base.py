    """`cursor-agent -p`, reached through the maintainer's Cursor subscription.

    One credential reaches five vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, Google, and
    Cursor's own Composer), which is the whole reason this backend exists: the
    roster's model-tier arms are the drift experiment's independent variable,
    and every vendor beyond Anthropic previously needed its own key.

    **This backend has no `--tools ""`, because cursor-agent has no such flag.**
    Its own `--help` says of print mode: "Has access to all tools, including
    write and shell." That is the identical exposure `claude -p` had on
    2026-08-19, when two dreams wrote `personality.md` straight to disk and the
    constitution layer (archive -> drift gate -> validators -> snapshot) was
    reduced to a suggestion. Measured against the real binary on 2026-08-21, an
    unguarded call created a file on the first try.

    So the guarantee is rebuilt out of three parts, and all three are per-call:

      1. `--mode ask` on the argv. Read-only Q&A mode. Verified to refuse, but
         it refuses in the MODEL'S voice ("I am in Ask mode, I cannot create
         files"), which makes it a system-prompt-level refusal -- the soft lock.
      2. A deny-everything permission config written into the workspace
         immediately before every call. Verified to refuse in the RUNTIME'S
         voice ("Permission denied: Command blocked by permissions
         configuration") while under `--force` AND a prompt explicitly telling
         the model to ignore its read-only instruction -- the hard lock.
      3. A fresh empty temp directory as the workspace. If both locks somehow
         failed there is nothing in reach to damage: the repository is never the
         workspace, and the directory is removed when the call returns.

    The config is rewritten on EVERY call rather than shipped as a file in the
    repo. A checked-in config is ambient state -- editable, deletable, and
    silently permissive once it drifts -- where the other backends' guarantee
    lives in the argv and is therefore reconstructed from scratch every time.
    Writing it per call is what restores that property. (The maintainer's own
    `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` is left alone, and is currently `"deny": []`
    with several `Shell(...)` entries allowed -- which is exactly why this
    backend must not depend on the global config.)

    `--force` / `--yolo` are never passed, and there is no code path here that
    can add them.
