"""Post-processing for raw LLM output.

Ports three routines:
  * collapse_doubled_text  (llm.sh:23)  — codex sometimes emits the body twice
  * extract_json_object    (llm.sh:41)  — brace-balanced, string-aware
  * normalize_plan         — flattens three accepted shapes (bare array, an
    object with a `plan` array, a single action object) into a Plan

The first two were embedded Python heredocs inside llm.sh and could not be
unit-tested; the echo-variance defect survived for months for exactly that
reason.

`normalize_plan` ports the jq pipeline at auto-run.sh:82. (An earlier version
of this docstring said that function did not exist in the committed tree —
true when written, since the multi-action pipeline was then uncommitted work
in the main checkout, and false since it landed in 9b9d3a7. Corrected rather
than deleted so the claim is not simply retracted without its history.)

One deliberate difference from the jq, recorded in the design spec's
known-differences section: `_to_action` drops wire fields whose value is an
empty string, so `{"postId": ""}` yields `post_id=None`. The jq keeps `""`,
which the guardrail's `(.postId // null) != null` then treats as present.
Nothing lands either way — the executor skips an action with no post id — but
Bash collapses two such actions to one in its dedupe and Python does not, so
the attempted tally and the veto list differ.
