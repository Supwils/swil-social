"""Post-processing for raw LLM output.

Ports three routines:
  * collapse_doubled_text  (llm.sh:23)  — codex sometimes emits the body twice
  * extract_json_object    (llm.sh:41)  — brace-balanced, string-aware
  * normalize_plan         — flattens three accepted shapes (bare array, an
    object with a `plan` array, a single action object) into a Plan

The first two were embedded Python heredocs inside llm.sh and could not be
unit-tested; the echo-variance defect survived for months for exactly that
reason. `normalize_plan` reproduces the multi-action plan pipeline described
by the task brief for this port — that pipeline is NOT present in the
committed agent/scripts/auto-run.sh in this worktree (no `normalize_plan`
function, no `"plan"` key anywhere in agent/scripts/); it exists as
uncommitted work in a different checkout. Its behaviour here is specified by
the task brief and the tests in this module, not by a line citation into
auto-run.sh.
