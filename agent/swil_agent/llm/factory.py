"""The one place a `Backend` is constructed from configuration.

`llm/selection.py` decides WHICH backend; this decides how to build it. They
are separate modules because the first is pure and the second touches a
subprocess runner, an API key and an HTTP transport -- and because a test that
wants to assert "this config resolves to grok on xAI" should not have to
construct anything that could dial out.

Every act/dream/cycle path reaches a backend through `get_backend`. Nothing
below the composition root spawns `claude` or `codex` on its own; the one
sanctioned exception is `llm/neutral.py`, the model-neutral ruler, which builds
its own argv precisely so it can never be routed through backend selection
(see that module, and `tests/unit/test_architecture.py`).

    `deepseek_api_key` and `transport` are injection seams for tests only, and

    `deepseek_api_key` docstring and `cli.py`'s `_health_check` transport.

    Note what is NOT passed to the CLI backends: the resolved model. Their
    `default_model` stays as it was, and the model reaches them the way it
    always has, through `CompletionRequest.model`. This matters for one real
    call: `dream/round.py`'s `_diff_narrative` passes `model=None` on purpose,
    to get the CLI's own default rather than the persona's model. Injecting the
    resolved model as a backend default would silently promote that call to
    opus for every opus account. `ApiBackend` has no CLI default to fall back
    to, so it does carry the model -- the asymmetry is the point, not an
    oversight.
