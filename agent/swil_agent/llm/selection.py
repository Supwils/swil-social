"""Which backend, which model, and where each answer came from.

One place resolves the question, so that every path -- act, dream, cycle --
runs the same model for the same reason, and so the round can SAY which model
it ran. `llm/base.py` knows how to talk to a backend; this module knows which
one to build.

**Precedence, highest first:**

    kind:  --backend flag  >  personality.md `AI Backend:`  >  SWIL_LLM_BACKEND  >  claude
    model: --model flag    >  personality.md `Model:`       >  SWIL_LLM_MODEL    >  backend default

The persona file sitting ABOVE the environment is the load-bearing half. Each
account's backend is the drift experiment's independent variable: an env var
that silently outranked the roster would re-assign every arm at once, and the
series either side of that round would be two experiments wearing one name. So
`SWIL_LLM_BACKEND` is a DEFAULT for accounts that declare nothing, not an
override -- and the explicit CLI flag, where the operator has named one
account and one model in one command, is the only thing that outranks the file.

That distinction needs "the file declares nothing" to be representable, which
is why `Persona` carries `declared_backend` (the raw bullet, `None` when
absent) beside `backend` (the same value defaulted to `"claude"`). Three
accounts -- hodlge, lvchuang, zaofan -- have no `AI Backend` bullet at all, so
this is a live case, not a hypothetical one.
