"""Bash-compatible per-account lock files under `agent/.agent-state/`.

These are a COEXISTENCE measure, not the destination. The design spec §7.3
replaces them with SQLite run leases in Plan 3, which is what actually fixes
the orphan-lock class of defect (a dead run's lease expires; a dead run's
lock file does not). Until then Python must use the same paths and the same
1800s staleness rule as auto-run.sh:411-433 and dream.sh:461-470, or a Python
round and a Bash round can hold the same account at the same time.

**The on-disk format is one or two lines.** Line 1 is the holder's pid and
nothing else, byte-for-byte what `echo "$$" > "$lock_file"` writes, because
`cat`-ing a stale lock during an incident is how an operator finds the
process (cli.py's own LeaseBusy remedy tells them to do exactly that). Line 2
is OPTIONAL and carries an `identity` token supplied by the caller -- a value
unique to *this acquisition*, so a holder can later tell its own file apart
from a replacement created at the same path after its lock was reclaimed as
stale. `read_lock_identity` is the reader.

Nothing in Bash reads either line. auto-run.sh:417 and dream.sh:463 create
the file with `( set -o noclobber; echo "$$" > … )`, decide staleness from
`stat` **mtime** alone (auto-run.sh:422, dream.sh:465), and release with
`rm -f` (auto-run.sh:428/439, dream.sh:471/479). So a second line is
invisible to the cross-runtime exclusion; what the two runtimes share is the
path, the mtime, and the file's existence.

    `None` is a real answer, not an error: a Bash-written lock (`echo "$$"`)
    is a bare pid, and so is a `FileLock` constructed without an `identity`.
    Either way the file is provably not one that a caller holding a token
    created, which is what the caller needs to know.

    A file this cannot READ raises instead, because the safe response to "I
    cannot tell" differs by call site and this function must not decide it: a
    holder deciding whether to REFRESH an mtime should treat it as not-mine,
    while a holder deciding whether to UNLINK on the way out should treat it
    as mine -- a stranded lock file costs the account every later round, which
    is the orphan-lock class this whole module exists to avoid.

    **Two exception types, and callers must catch both.** `OSError` covers
    missing/unreadable. Bytes that are not UTF-8 raise `UnicodeDecodeError`,
    which is a `ValueError` and therefore NOT caught by `except OSError` --
    the trap that hid this for a review round. Callers that treat a failure as
    "unknown" must spell `except (OSError, UnicodeDecodeError)`.

    """`identity`, when given, is written on the file's second line.

    It must be unique to this acquisition -- `uuid4().hex`, not a pid and not
    a run id derived from one. The point is to let a holder whose lock was
    reclaimed as stale recognise that the file now at its path is a
    *successor's*, and anything a later process can be handed again (a pid, an
    inode number) cannot do that.

    It must also be exactly one non-empty line, and that is **enforced here
    rather than documented here**. It is written verbatim, so a line break
    would push the rest onto line 3 and an empty string would fail the
    reader's own emptiness test -- either way `read_lock_identity` returns
    something that never equals what the holder is comparing against, the
    holder reads its own live lock as a stranger's forever, and it therefore
    never refreshes the mtime and never unlinks. That is a stranded lock every
    round, arriving silently. A `ValueError` at construction turns a rule a
    comment could only assert into one a test can pin.

    Omitting it keeps the file byte-for-byte identical to Bash's own output,
    which is what the callers that never need to re-identify their file
    (`run_act`, `run_dream`, whose locks live and die inside a single `with`)
    should do.
