    second, dm-only field rather than overloading `resource_id` or `detail`
    (the latter is already a free-text failure/note channel matched by
    shape elsewhere -- see `act/round.py`'s `_PARENT_UNUSABLE_DETAIL`
    sentinel). It lets `act/round.py`'s memory-line writer record
    `conversationId=...` the way `swil.sh:711`'s `_remember` does, instead
    of the `messageId=` substitute this task shipped with initially.

    `call_succeeded` (ruling R19) answers a DIFFERENT question from `landed`:
    did the underlying `swil.sh` subcommand actually exit 0 -- i.e. did the
    write go through -- rather than does this action count toward the round's
    landed tally. For every action kind the two are equal, and
    `act/executor.py`'s `_outcome` derives one from the other by default so
    they cannot drift apart by accident. `follow` is the ONE kind where they
    legitimately differ: `auto-run.sh:250-252` returns 0 whether the follow
    landed or 409'd ("Deliberately 0 either way: 'already following' is the
    common outcome and is not a failed round"), while `swil.sh`'s own `follow`
    case never reaches `_remember` on that 409 -- `_curl` returns 1 for any
    status >= 400 (swil.sh:132-135) and `set -euo pipefail` aborts the case at
    the failing pipeline. So a 409 is a landed round AND an unwritten memory
    line, which needs two fields to say.

    """Everything one dream measured about its own drift, recorded whatever
    the gate then decided with it (Phase B task 1; spec §8.1).

    This type exists because the `/lab` drift series was CENSORED: the
    numbers were computed only as an input to an accept/reject decision, and
    only an ACCEPTED dream left a `personalitysnapshots` row behind. The
    recorded distribution was therefore "drift among the versions the gate
    allowed", not drift -- and a threshold calibrated on it is calibrated on
    its own survivors. Every path through `dream.gate.evaluate_candidate`
    now produces one of these, INCLUDING the structural-failure path that
    returns before a single embed is attempted.

    `None` is a first-class value here and is NOT interchangeable with
    `0.0`: it means "this quantity was not computed", which is a different
    fact from "this quantity was measured and came out at zero". A
    structural rejection or an embedder outage records `None`; recording
    `0.0` would put a fake "maximally drifted" point into the calibration
    sample, which is the mirror image of the censoring this type exists to
    end.

    The three quantities, and why there are three:

      * `anchor_sim` -- cosine(anchor, candidate). POSITION: how far the
        candidate sits from the account's origin. This is the same number as
        `DreamVerdict.scalar_sim` and the same number today's scalar gate
        decides on; carried here as well because the verdict is the gate's
        working state while this is the record.
      * `step_sim` -- cosine(current personality.md, candidate). STEP SIZE:
        how far THIS dream moves the account, independent of where it
        already stood. A position gate cannot see a series of small steps
        walking an account away from its anchor and cannot tell a large
        single jump from a small one that happens to land far out.
      * `aspects` -- the per-aspect (values/style/topic) similarities, when
        the aspect pipeline produced them; `None` when it did not (scalar
        mode, a dead distiller, or a failed card embed).

    `embedder_ok` is FALSE only when an embed attempted FOR THIS
    MEASUREMENT raised `EmbedderUnavailable` -- i.e. the whole-doc embeds
    behind `anchor_sim`/`step_sim`. A path that attempted none (the
    structural rejection, which returns before any embedding) records
    `True`: it observed no outage, and its `None` sims already say the
    measurement did not happen. Counting `embedder_ok is False` therefore
    counts embedder outages, not "rounds with no numbers".

    `mode` is the `DRIFT_MODE` the round ran under, recorded alongside the
    numbers so a later analyst reading a window of rows does not have to
    infer which regime produced them from the deploy history.

    is populated only outside scalar `DRIFT_MODE` and only when the aspect
    distill/embed pipeline succeeded; `scalar_sim` is populated whenever the
    whole-doc scalar embed pair succeeded, which `evaluate_candidate` always
    attempts regardless of `DRIFT_MODE` (it is the gate itself in scalar/
    shadow modes, and the aspect-mode fallback). A dream can therefore carry

    fail-open distinction: "no value" and "value 0.0" are different states,
    and a caller building a metrics payload from this field (`dream/round.py`

    `embedder_unreachable` is that same lesson applied to the same `reason`

    measured and fail-opened -- i.e. this dream landed UNGATED
    (`dream/gate.py`, `dream.sh:797-807`). It is deliberately not derivable
    from `scalar_sim is None` alone: in `aspect` mode with usable aspect sims
    the aspect gate decides and a `None` `scalar_sim` gated nothing, so only
    the gate itself knows which branch actually made the call. It exists
    because `reason` is COMPOSED (`f"{aspect_note}; {base_reason}"`), so a
