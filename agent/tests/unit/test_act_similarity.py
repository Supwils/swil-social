"""Act-path self-similarity, SHADOW ONLY (Phase B task 2).

The act path -- the half of the cycle that decides and posts -- has no guard
on what it emits. `liushang` has been collapsing onto one recycled phrase
since 2026-07-22: the dream gate rejects its personality rewrites round after
round and cannot touch its posts, because nothing between "the model produced
this text" and "the text is on the platform" ever looks at what the account
already said.

This file pins the MEASUREMENT of that, and pins equally hard that it is only
a measurement. Three properties carry most of the weight:

  * The corpus is the account's OWN recent posts. A candidate compared against
    the feed measures roster homogenisation -- a real quantity, computed
    population-wide by `/lab`'s Feature 3, but a different one with a
    different distribution and therefore a different threshold. That mutation
    produces entirely plausible numbers and calibrates the wrong guard, so it
    is pinned on the embedder's INPUTS, never on the similarity it returns:
    standing constraint §4, and the reason `RecordingEmbedder` below refuses
    a text it was not told about instead of handing back a placeholder.
  * Nothing about the round changes. Asserted on the recorded API call, not
    on a return value.
  * `None` is not `0.0`. An account with nothing to compare against records
    "not computed"; recording `0.0` would put a fabricated "maximally
    diverse" point into the calibration sample this series exists to collect.

Vectors are ONE-DIMENSIONAL throughout. The daemon returns L2-normalised
vectors, so over one dimension the dot product IS the cosine similarity and a
fixture can pin an exact expected value without hand-normalising anything --
the same trick `test_gate.py`, `test_drift.py` and `test_drift_measurement.py`
already use.
