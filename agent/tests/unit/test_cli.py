"""Tests for `swil_agent.cli` (task 13) -- the `swil-agent` entrypoints that
compose every layer built by Tasks 1-12 into `act`/`dream`/`version`
commands.

`cli.py` is the ONLY composition root in the package (module docstring), so
these tests exercise it two ways:

  * through `typer.testing.CliRunner`, with every network/subprocess-facing
    builder (`_resources_for`, `_backend_for`, `_embedder_for`, `_guard_for`,
    `_health_check`) monkeypatched to an in-memory fake -- a CLI test must
    never dial a real socket or spawn a real `claude`/`codex`/`bash` process;
  * directly, for the builder helpers themselves (`_resources_for` with a
    real `ApiClient` over `httpx.MockTransport`, `_health_check` the same
    way, `_probe_embedder` against a fake `EmbedderClient`), so the
    composition helpers are not only ever exercised through a monkeypatched
    substitute of themselves.

No test in this file ever calls the real `load_settings()` against
`agent/.env` -- that file is deliberately absent from this worktree (see
CLAUDE.md's "Manual deploys only" / the task-13 brief), and every test here
builds its own `Settings(agent_root=tmp_path, ...)` instead.
