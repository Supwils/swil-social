    only by failing this test**, and the previous two attempts to say so both
    could not.

    History, because the shape matters more than the fix: this assertion was
    first written as `monkeypatch.setenv("LANGGRAPH_STRICT_MSGPACK", "true")`,
    which is inert -- the constant is read once at import. It was then
    "fixed" with `monkeypatch.setattr(lg_msgpack, "STRICT_MSGPACK_ENABLED",
    True)`, which is ALSO insufficient, for the same structural reason one
    level up: `BaseCheckpointSaver.serde` is an import-time CLASS ATTRIBUTE
    (`serde: SerializerProtocol = JsonPlusSerializer()`), so a naive
    `SqliteSaver(conn)` gets a serializer constructed long before any
    `setattr` lands, carrying the permissive `allowed_msgpack_modules=True`.
    Dropping our explicit allowlist entirely left the suite green.

    So this test asserts nothing about WHEN a constant is read. It asserts the
    OBSERVABLE consequence of the allowlist being explicit and closed: a type
    that is NOT on it is refused. Measured against langgraph 1.2.11:

      * explicit allowlist -> an unregistered `AspectVectors` comes back as a
        plain `dict` (logged: "Blocked deserialization ... not in
        allowed_msgpack_modules");
      * the library default -> the same value comes back as a real
        `AspectVectors` (logged: "Deserializing unregistered type ... will be
        blocked in a future version").

    `AspectVectors` is the right probe precisely because it is NOT reachable
    from `CycleState` -- `test_the_derived_registration_covers_every_model_
    reachable_from_cycle_state` is what keeps that true, so the two tests
    fail together rather than drifting apart.
