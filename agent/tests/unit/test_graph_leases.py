"""Run leases (task 3, spec §7.3).

Spec §7.3 read literally -- the PID lock files "become a row in SQLite" --
would silently destroy mutual exclusion during migration stages 3 and 4,
which is exactly when Bash and Python run the same 23-account roster. A Bash
round cannot see a SQLite row. So a lease holds BOTH: the row (identity,
heartbeat, expiry, and the death of the orphan-lock class) and the
Bash-visible file lock (cross-runtime exclusion). The file lock goes away at
stage 5, when Bash no longer runs.
