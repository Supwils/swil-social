"""The cycle's node functions (Plan 3 Task 7, spec §5.4).

A node adapts `CycleState` to one or more of the step functions Tasks 5 and 6
extracted, and does nothing else. So what these tests can see -- and what
`test_act_round.py` / `test_dream_round.py` (the two composition oracles) and
`test_act_steps.py` / `test_dream_steps.py` (the step-level pins) cannot -- is
exactly the wiring in between:

  * **A value that never crosses a node boundary.** The steps are correct in
    isolation; the graph fails by dropping what one node produced before the
    next one reads it. `narrative` is the sharp case: `write_step` computes
    it and `snapshot_step` uploads it as `diffNarrative`, and an unthreaded
    `CycleState` field between them empties that column for every snapshot
    with the whole 952-test suite green.
  * **A guard that stops being load-bearing on the graph path.** The two
    composition-shape pins in `test_dream_steps.py` monkeypatch
    `dream.round`'s MODULE GLOBALS, which is what makes them work for
    `run_dream` -- and what makes them blind here: `nodes.py` binds
    `write_step` / `snapshot_step` into its OWN globals at import, so those
    spies never see a node's call. The equivalents live in this file,
    patching `graph.nodes`.
  * **`dry_run` that reaches the steps that write.** Stage 3 is a
    `--dry-run` shadow round across 23 live accounts. A node that forgets to
    thread it posts to production.
  * **The account's identity.** `agent_name` is the persona DIRECTORY name
    (`basename "$agent_dir"`, auto-run.sh:407), never the `Username` bullet;
    the two diverge on this roster. Every node test that names an account
    uses a persona where they differ, so a node reaching for the wrong one
    is visible rather than coincidentally correct.
