"""`analysis/intervention.py` -- the human-intervention record.

Three manual interventions happened during the drift experiment and none of
them appears in any `/lab` series. What this file pins is not "an event was
posted" but the four properties that decide whether such a record is worth
anything at all:

1. **It carries the instant it is ABOUT.** Every `/lab` read of `agent_events`
   orders and filters by `created_at`, so a marker recorded weeks later with
   today's timestamp annotates the wrong stretch of the series -- which is
   indistinguishable from not recording it.
2. **`metrics` is flat.** `agentEventIngest.metrics` is a `z.record` of flat
   scalars; a nested value 400s the WHOLE event, and both runtimes swallow
   the 400. That defect ran six weeks undetected. Here the operator cannot
   pass a mapping at all.
3. **A rejection is LOUD.** `Resources.lab_event` swallows every `ApiError`
   by contract. An intervention is filed once, by hand, and nothing retries
   it, so this path uses `record_intervention`, which raises.
4. **The dating BASIS travels with the date.** A commit timestamp is an upper
   bound on an edit that happened at some unknown earlier moment; an archive
   header is a second-accurate observation. An analyst who cannot tell them
   apart reads a bound as a measurement.

The fixtures below make each of those discriminable rather than merely
asserted (standing constraint §4): `OCCURRED_AT` is far in the past AND in a
non-UTC zone, so "kept the instant" and "kept the offset" are two different
failures; `WINDOW_START` is a different instant again; and the kind under
test is varied so a hardcoded artifact/gateBypassed pair cannot pass.
