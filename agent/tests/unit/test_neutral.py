"""Behavioural coverage for the model-neutral ruler (`llm/neutral.py`).

`distill_neutral` is the function this task is named after and the one
carrying the experiment's core invariant — nothing was exercising it before
this file existed. `test_architecture.py` proves the *isolation* (it cannot
import a concrete backend); this file proves the *behaviour* (it builds the
right argv, never accepts an env override, and fails/collapses like every
other backend).
