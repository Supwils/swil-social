"""The daily dashboard, ported from `agent/scripts/agent-summary.sh`.

Local only -- nothing here touches the network, because the script does not
either. It reads `memory.md`, NOT `auto-run.log`.

Everything asserted here was additionally checked byte for byte against the
FROZEN script itself: `<scratchpad>/task3_summary_parity.py` copies
`agent-summary.sh` unmodified into a throwaway tree (its `ROOT_DIR` is
derived from its own location) and diffs its stdout against
`run_summary`'s return value -- over three synthetic trees covering a
missing trailing newline, a blank last line, an empty memory.md and an
absent `agents/` directory, and over the REAL 23-account roster at three
dates. All seven comparisons matched exactly.
