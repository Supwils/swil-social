"""The world-context blocks `swil.sh login` used to write to disk.

Background, and why these tests are shaped the way they are. `swil.sh login`
wrote three artifacts -- `context/now.md`, `context/news_today.md`, and one
`context/feed_for_<username>.md` per account. The Python runtime became the
runtime of record on 2026-08-19 (`cycle-one.sh:45` dispatches straight to
`swil-agent cycle`) and nothing in it calls `swil.sh`, so it READ two of those
three files and WROTE none. Every round after the cutover was handed a
`now.md` frozen at 2026-08-19 05:30 -- a header telling all 23 accounts that
the date was the 19th and that they were `qiusai`'s session -- plus a news
digest dated 2026-08-18 and whatever follow-topics slice happened to be on
disk.

Three properties are pinned here, one per failure mode that produced:

  * FRESHNESS -- the date comes from an injected clock, and two clocks give
    two answers. A test with a single clock cannot tell a rendered date from
    a hardcoded one.
  * PER-ACCOUNT -- `now.md` was ONE shared file carrying a per-account
    `当前 Agent` line, which is why five parallel rounds raced on it and the
    file named a single account. Every test that could catch a regression
    here renders TWO accounts in one process and compares, because an
    assertion about a per-account value attached to a single-account render
    cannot distinguish an argument from a module-level constant.
  * TEMPLATE FIDELITY (ruling R28) -- the drift experiment is in flight, so
    only the FRESHNESS of the content may change, never the wording. The
    template is pinned against `agent/scripts/swil.sh`'s own heredoc, read
    out of the script at test time and byte-compared, rather than against a
    copy of it transcribed into this file: a transcription drifts silently
    from the thing it claims to pin, and the script is the source of truth
    (STANDING-CONSTRAINTS §1).

# ── §14: every pin below reads EXECUTABLE text, never a comment ───────────
#
# STANDING-CONSTRAINTS §14, paid for three times now. The first was a
# Bash-side guard that searched a script for `--tools ""` while the fix's own
# explanatory comment contained that string. The second was this file: bare
# `index`/`re.search` over raw source, so a commented-out copy of a line above
# a reworded real one satisfied the pin completely. The third was the FIX for
# the second -- it grouped `\`-continuations before testing for comment-ness,
# and since bash does NOT continue a comment line, a `\`-terminated comment
# hid the executable line under it from the view while bash still ran it.
#
# So the failure has two directions and both are live:
#
#   * a comment SATISFYING an anchor -- the decoy above the real line;
#   * a comment HIDING the line that contradicts an anchor -- the
#     `\`-terminated comment, and a mid-line `#` parking the original text
#     after a renamed real assignment.
#
# Three rules close them, and all three are enforced in ONE place
# (`_code_hits` / `_code_match`) so there is one guard to pin rather than
# four copies to keep in step:
#
#   1. a physical line whose first non-blank character is `#` contributes
#      nothing, and does NOT swallow the line after it;
#   2. `\`-continuations are joined, so the "what precedes the anchor" test
#      below sees the whole line bash executes, and so an anchor that spans
#      a join is still findable (no anchor here spans one today -- the
#      topic-row jq lies wholly on `swil.sh:395`, which is a continuation of
#      the `curl` on `:394` -- but the rule is what keeps that true);
#   3. a match counts only if the text BEFORE it on its joined line contains
#      no `#`.
#
# Rule 3 is deliberately not "cut each line at its first `#`". That rule
# would truncate `swil.sh:398` -- `FEED_CONTENT+="## #${FT_TOPIC}\n…"` -- at
# `## `, turning a live anchor into a false failure. Filtering match
# POSITIONS instead never shortens anything: the `#`s in that line are all
# AFTER the anchor, so it still matches, and its extracted fragment is
# unchanged (pinned by the expansions test below).

    Comment-ness is tested on each PHYSICAL line BEFORE anything is joined to

    comment: `# … \\` followed by `X=2` still executes `X=2`, because the `\\`
    is inside the comment and never reaches the line-continuation rule.
    Testing after the join deletes that `X=2` from the view -- which is a
    comment hiding the code that contradicts a pin, the inverse of the attack

    Two numbers, both read out of the script so this stays true when the
    script moves:

      * `_lock`'s spinlock cap -- `(( waited > N )) && return 1` with one
        `sleep 1` per iteration (`news-fetch.sh:70,74`), so N seconds of
        waiting before the lock is either acquired or given up on.
      * the download bound -- `NEWS_TIMEOUT`'s default, passed to
        `curl --max-time` (`news-fetch.sh:42,88`).

    They ADD rather than alternate on the reachable path: the cap only ends
    the WAIT, so a lock released at second N is followed by a full download.
    The jq render and the `mv` sit on top of both and are not modelled --
    which is why the assertion below is a strict `>` with room, not `>=`.

    Both numbers are read out of the EXECUTABLE view through
    `_the_code_match` (§14). A bare `re.search` over raw source took the
    first textual match, so commenting out the original `NEWS_TIMEOUT` line
    above a raised real one left this green with the script's true ceiling at
    320s against a 180s bound.

    What this models is the `:-N` DEFAULT, not the effective value of
    `NEWS_TIMEOUT` at the `curl`. Those differ the moment there are two
    assignments -- `${NEWS_TIMEOUT:-200}` above `${NEWS_TIMEOUT:-45}` leaves
    the variable at 200, because the second `:-` sees it already set -- and a
    first-match reader would report 200 while a last-match reader reported
    45, both confidently. Rather than pick, `_the_code_match` refuses: two
    executable assignments fail the uniqueness assertion by name. That is
    also why the env-var override is not modelled at all; a caller who
    exports `NEWS_TIMEOUT` has left the budget this constant was derived
    against, and no static read of the script can tell.
