/**
 * Tests for `DriftCountdownPanel`.
 *
 * FIXTURE RULE THIS SUITE OBEYS (standing constraint §4, found eleven times on
 * this codebase): every pinned value must be distinguishable from every value
 * the code could plausibly have used instead.
 *
 *   - `range` is `90d` / `7d`, NEVER `30d` — which is both the endpoint's own
 *     default and what every other query in `AgentDetail` asks for, so a panel
 *     that dropped the argument or hardcoded it would pass a `30d` fixture.
 *   - `roundIntervalHours` is 36 and `maxExtrapolation` is 4 — not the server's
 *     48 and 3, so a client-side copy of either constant is caught.
 *   - the four thresholds are 0.44 / 0.55 / 0.66 / 0.61 — none of them the real
 *     0.82 / 0.63 / 0.72 / 0.71, so the deleted `ASPECT_THRESHOLDS` cannot come
 *     back unnoticed, and all four differ from each other so a cross-series
 *     mix-up is visible.
 *   - `asOf` is a fixed instant and nothing here reads the real clock: a
 *     fixture that agrees with `new Date()` cannot disagree with code that
 *     calls it.
 *   - the four `latestAt` instants fall on FOUR different days (08-16 / 08-17 /
 *     08-13 / 08-11), none of them `asOf`'s day and none of them `crossesAt`'s.
 *     They used to be 08-18 / 08-19 / 08-19 / 08-19, and `day()` truncates, so
 *     three of the four rendered identically and a row printing another series'
 *     date — or `asOf` in place of a measurement — could not be seen.
