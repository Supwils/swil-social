# Contributing

Short and opinionated. This is a single-maintainer project; the rules here exist
to keep the codebase and `/docs` coherent across agent-assisted sessions as much
as human ones.

Everything below describes what the repo **actually does**. Where tooling
enforces something, the enforcing file is named — check it rather than trusting
a number copied into prose.

## For agents picking up the repo

1. **Read `docs/12-handoff.md` first.** It reflects the current round's state and
   what's next.
2. Then skim `docs/10-roadmap.md` to see where the current work fits.
3. Then read the relevant architecture / design / API doc for the area you're
   touching.
4. When you finish a round, update `12-handoff.md`, bump statuses in
   `10-roadmap.md`, and bump `last-updated` / `owner` on any doc you edited.

**Commit policy:** never `git commit` or `git push` unless the user's message
explicitly authorises it. Editing files, installing deps and running `ci:check`
need no permission.

## Conventions

### Commits

Conventional Commits, **enforced** by the `commit-msg` hook via commitlint
(`commitlint.config.js`, extending `@commitlint/config-conventional`).

```
<type>(<scope>)?: <subject>
```

**11 allowed types** — `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`,
`test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. Anything else fails the hook.

**Keep it short.** One line. Two sentences in the subject at most. Do not
write a task-log body (`Task 4 of 8`, review findings, file lists). The
subject should tell a stranger what landed; `git show` is for the diff.

A body is allowed only when the *why* cannot fit in the subject —
migrations, reverts, experiment change points. No body by default.

Other rules actually configured:

| Rule | Setting |
|---|---|
| `type-enum` | error — the 11 types above |
| `subject-max-length` | error at 100 |
| `header-max-length` | error at 120 |
| `body-max-line-length` | **disabled** |
| `footer-max-line-length` | **disabled** |
| `scope-enum` | **disabled** — scope is free-form, and optional |

Examples:
- `feat(posts): add tag extraction`
- `fix(auth): regenerate session on login to prevent fixation`
- `docs: record the loop-engine operator path`

**Cadence on `main`: two or three commits a day, not a task stream.** SDD
and subagent loops may commit per task on a feature branch — that is local
scaffolding. Before landing on `main` (or before a push that rewrites
`main`), squash to 2–3 commits that name the outcome, not the steps. A
day of agent work that produces 20 conventional-commit subjects is a
tell; squash it.

Bypass with `--no-verify` only when you have a reason you'd write down.

### Branches and PRs — the actual model

The repo is **trunk-based and effectively PR-free**:

- Work happens directly on `main`. History is linear; there is exactly **one**
  merge commit in the whole repo (`e949e22`, PR #1, from before the current
  workflow settled).
- There is **no PR template**, no `phase-N/slug` branch convention, and no
  squash-merge policy — earlier versions of this doc described all three, and
  none of them existed.
- Long-lived branches show up only for genuinely risky work
  (`migrate/mongoose-to-neon` is the one surviving example) and are merged or
  landed by fast-forward, not by PR ceremony.
- The stale `dependabot/*` branches on the remote are residue from before
  Dependabot was removed (commit `10b5aa3`). Ignore them; the bot is off.

So the checklist that used to live under "Pull requests" is really a
**pre-commit checklist**:

- `npm run ci:check` green.
- `/docs` updated if behavior or contracts changed.
- `docs/12-handoff.md` updated if you closed a unit of work.
- A commit body that says *why* for anything non-obvious (especially new deps).

If a real PR flow is ever adopted, write it here first — don't let this file
describe a process nobody follows.

### Local hooks — plain shell, no husky

Hooks live in `scripts/git-hooks/` as ordinary bash scripts. `npm run
install-hooks` runs `scripts/install-hooks.sh`, which **symlinks** them into
`.git/hooks/` (`ln -sf`, idempotent, safe to re-run). There is **no husky and no
lint-staged** anywhere in this repo — an earlier version of this doc claimed
otherwise.

| Hook | Runs |
|---|---|
| `commit-msg` | `commitlint --edit` |
| `pre-commit` | gitleaks (if installed) → typecheck ×2 → lint ×2 → test ×2. No build. |
| `pre-push` | same, plus build server + build client |

**Prettier is not enforced by any hook, and not by CI either.** `npm run format`
and `npm run format:check` exist, but nothing gates on them. Formatting drift is
caught only by the ESLint rules that overlap with it. Run `npm run format`
before committing as a courtesy, not because something will stop you.

**Lint now fails on warnings.** Both packages run
`eslint … --max-warnings=0`, so a warning (e.g. `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`)
breaks the build exactly like an error does. Fix it or write an explicit
`eslint-disable` with a reason — you cannot let it slide.

### `ci:check` — 10 steps

**Before every commit and push:**

```bash
npm run ci:check
```

`scripts/ci-check.sh` mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml` step for step:

1. Typecheck server
2. Typecheck client
3. Lint server (eslint, `--max-warnings=0`)
4. Lint client (eslint, `--max-warnings=0`)
5. Test server (vitest)
6. Test client (vitest)
7. **Typecheck mcp**
8. **Test mcp**
9. Build server
10. Build client (with `VITE_API_BASE=/api/v1`)

Steps 7–8 are the ones people forget the repo has: the `mcp/` package is a real
CI citizen, and skipping it locally is the most common way to push a red build.

**Preconditions — `ci:check` is not hermetic:**

- **A pgvector-enabled Postgres must be reachable.** Server tests run against a
  real database (Drizzle migrations, seeded rows, `vector` columns), not a mock.
  CI provides it as a `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` service; locally you need an
  equivalent instance up before step 5. See `server/src/test/setup.ts` for the
  connection defaults.
- **`mcp/` dependencies must be installed.** `npm run install:all` covers root +
  server + client + mcp; a plain `npm install` at the root does not, and steps
  7–8 will fail on a missing `node_modules`.

Hooks run subsets (pre-commit omits the build), so for anything touching build
config, dependencies, ESLint config or the CI workflow itself, run `ci:check`
manually. The classic failure it catches: removing a package that is referenced
only from a build-config string (`manualChunks: ['cmdk']`) typechecks clean and
only `vite build` notices.

### Secret scanning

`gitleaks` is a **hard gate in CI** (`.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`) — it runs
on every push to `main` and every PR, with full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) and
the repo config `.gitleaks.toml`.

Locally it is **best-effort**: `pre-commit` and `pre-push` invoke it only if the
binary is on `$PATH`.

```bash
brew install gitleaks     # recommended — catches a leak before it's a commit
```

Do **not** add allowlist entries to silence a real finding. Rotate the secret and
remove it from the diff. `.gitleaks.toml`'s allowlist is only for files that hold
placeholder values by design.

### The e2e lane is manual

```bash
npm run test:e2e          # headless
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Playwright UI mode
```

Playwright (`playwright.config.ts`) boots the real stack on dedicated ports
(client 5948, server 8901) against a dedicated database (`swil_e2e_pg`, created
/ migrated / truncated by `server/scripts/ensure-e2e-db.ts`), so it never
collides with `npm run dev`.

**It is not part of CI and not part of `ci:check`** — by design. It needs a live
Postgres and two dev servers, and takes long enough that gating every commit on
it would not be worth it. Run it yourself when you touch auth, registration, or
the BYOA lifecycle (the flows `e2e/auth.spec.ts` and `e2e/byoa.spec.ts` cover).

### Code style

- TypeScript strict mode. `any` is a lint **error**, not a convention.
- Prettier config at the repo root: single quotes, trailing commas, 100 cols.
  Not enforced (see above) — run `npm run format`.
- No hex colors in components — use tokens.
- No scattered `axios.*()` calls — route through `client/src/api/`.
- No `console.log` in committed code — use `logger` (server) or guard with
  `import.meta.env.DEV` (client).
- Empty `catch` is allowed; it is used deliberately for fire-and-forget
  telemetry.

### Tests

- Backend: Vitest + supertest against a real Postgres. One describe per module;
  one case per service method, plus an HTTP happy path and at least one
  auth/validation failure.
- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom. Smoke test each route,
  detailed tests for non-trivial components (composer, thread rendering).
- **Coverage is gated.** The authoritative numbers live in
  `server/vitest.config.ts` and `client/vite.config.ts` — read them there rather
  than trusting a copy. As of 2026-08-01 the floors are roughly: server 50 lines
  / 55 branches / 50 functions / 50 statements; client 6.5 / 5 / 5 / 6, lifted on
  2026-07-31 to just under the measured values after the first real ratchet.
  Both files carry a ratchet log in comments — append to it when you move a
  number.
- Run `npm run test:coverage` to see the breakdown.
- Don't lower a threshold to make CI pass. Write the test, or state the reason in
  the commit body. The client floors are low because the routes tree is barely
  covered; the fix is render tests, not more unit tests on pure helpers.

### Documentation

- Docs live in `/docs` — not in component headers, not only in commit bodies.
- When a contract changes (API shape, schema, auth behavior), update the relevant
  `docs/` file in the same commit.
- **A doc that overstates reality is worse than no doc.** If you can't point at
  the code that implements a claim, mark it ⏳/❌ or delete it. `06-security.md`
  and `05-auth-flow.md` were rewritten in Round 23 for exactly this reason.
- ADRs for non-obvious decisions: if you're choosing between two reasonable
  options and the runner-up isn't obviously wrong, write one.

## What not to do

- Don't introduce a new dependency without saying why in the commit body. Run
  `npm run knip` first to be sure it isn't a duplicate.
- Don't add feature flags or A/B scaffolding. If a feature isn't ready, it isn't
  merged.
- Don't add error handling for impossible cases. Validate at the boundary
  (request body, env, user input); trust internal calls.
- Don't write backwards-compat shims — there are no external consumers.
- Don't commit `.env`, dump files, `*.key`, or anything under
  `agent/agents/*/api_key.txt`. `.gitignore` blocks most; gitleaks catches the
  rest.
- Don't edit a bash script in `agent/scripts/` while an agent round is running —
  in-place edits corrupt the live process. Write to a temp file and `mv`.
