/**
 * The act-path collapse watch, against the real test Postgres.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THESE TESTS EXIST TO PREVENT: a one-legged result rendering as
 * a two-legged one. The `maxSim` half of this detector did not exist before
 * 2026-08-19, so every historical window — including the only collapse we can
 * validate against — has exactly one leg, and an endpoint that quietly called
 * that "collapsing" would be claiming corroboration it never had.
 *
 * FIXTURE DESIGN (standing constraint §4). Three things this file does
 * deliberately, each because the sibling countdown shipped without them and
 * paid for it:
 *
 *  1. NO SHARED OFFSET CONSTANT. `agents.countdown.test.ts` drew every fixture's
 *     instants from one `DAYS = [-8,-6,-4,-2]`, which forced two degeneracies on
 *     the whole suite at once — the data always stopped the same distance from
 *     the reference instant, and the spacing was always uniform, so `mean(xs)`
 *     always equalled the midpoint of its range. Every fixture here picks its
 *     own irregular offsets, and the two series inside one fixture are offset
 *     from each other so that fitting the wrong one moves a number.
 *  2. THE TWO SERIES NEVER SHARE A VALUE, A COUNT OR AN INSTANT. Post lengths
 *     are tens of characters and similarities are fractions, so swapping them
 *     is not a subtle change; but their `n`, their `spanDays` and their
 *     endpoints differ too, so a partial swap moves something as well.
 *  3. ASSERTIONS ARE EXACT, never inequalities. A `toBeLessThan(0)` on a slope
 *     is satisfied by the true value AND by most wrong ones — that is precisely
 *     how the countdown's non-uniform fixture failed to discriminate the
 *     `xBar`-as-midpoint mutant it was written to catch. The one exception is
 *     the HTTP clock pin at the bottom of this file, where the pinned quantity
 *     IS "now" and has no literal to assert against: it brackets the wire's
 *     `until` between two reads of the real clock taken either side of the
 *     request, which is a window of milliseconds rather than a one-sided bound.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER IS HAND-COMPUTED, not read off the implementation: OLS of the
 * quantity against days-since-the-first-point, the slope rounded to 6dp, then
 * the intercept, `r2` and `slopeStdErr` taken against THAT rounded line.

   * recycled phrase while the dream gate rejected round after round, correctly,
   * and nothing watched what was actually being posted.
   *
   * THE TEXTS ARE REAL AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING, not decoration. They are CJK,
   * where one character is three UTF-8 bytes — so the 40-character post below is
   * 120 bytes, and an implementation reaching for `octet_length` instead of
   * `char_length` reports every number in this test three times too large. A
   * fixture of ASCII filler could not tell those two apart.
   *

   * is four days before it opens and 2026-08-13 is eight days after it closes,
   * at different distances, so dropping either bound — or applying one bound
   * twice — changes `n`.
   *
   * The 2026-07-25 12:01 row is a human's board-repair verification post, not a
