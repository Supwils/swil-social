/**
 * Act-path collapse watch — is an account's OUTPUT rotting?
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR, and it is a specific failure that already happened.
 * `liushang` spent five weeks contracting onto one recycled phrase — posts
 * falling from ~40 characters to ~22 — while its dreams were being rejected
 * round after round, correctly, by the constitution layer. The gate was working
 * and the account rotted anyway, because the gate screens the STATED self
 * (`personality.md`) and nothing watched the REVEALED self (what actually got
 * posted). A human noticed, eventually. This is the instrument that should
 * have.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It measures; it enforces nothing. No number here reaches the
 * gate, the act path, or any prompt, and there is deliberately no act-path
 * threshold anywhere in this file's reach — `agent/swil_agent/config.py:71-74`
 * leaves the act-path similarity in shadow on purpose and this endpoint does
 * not change that. A `verdict` of `collapsing` blocks nothing.
 *
 * TWO SERIES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM HAS A PAST.
 *
 *   1. POST LENGTH — `char_length(posts.text)` per post, back to 2026-04.
 *      Two covering indexes already serve it (`db/schema/social.ts:123-124`).
 *      This is the half that can be validated against a known collapse.
 *   2. SELF-SIMILARITY — the act path's `maxSim`: the round's candidate post
 *      against the account's own last 12 posts, filed as `agent_events` with
 *      `summary='act self-similarity measured'` (`act/round.py:1085-1149`).
 *      It STARTS 2026-08-19 (`d53951b`) and only POSTING rounds emit it, so a
 *      comment-only, like-only or quiet round leaves no row.
 *
 * So `basis: 'length-only'` is the NORMAL answer for anything historical, not a
 * rare degradation, and the DTO makes a one-legged result structurally
 * impossible to mistake for a two-legged one: `verdict: 'collapsing'` is
 * unreachable unless `basis === 'both'`.
 *
 * WHY NOT `behavior_snapshots`, which looks like it should serve this.
 * `commentCount` on it is a literal `0` (`analysis/behavior_snapshot.py:190`),
 * and `excerpt` is a 280-character truncation of the JOINED document, so it
 * saturates the moment an account writes more than a few posts and carries no
 * length signal at all. And no length metric exists anywhere in `agent_events`:
 * the executor's `post` event carries no `metrics`.
 *
 * WHY A DEDICATED QUERY rather than `getAgentEvents`. It caps `limit` at 50 and
 * takes no date range (`agents.events.ts:37`) — the same reason the countdown
 * next door has its own.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS EXPLICIT, AND THAT IS NOT COSMETIC. The sibling countdown takes
 * a `range` enum and fits back from `asOf`; this one takes `since`/`until`,
 * because the answer depends on the window far more sharply than a drift fit
 * does. Measured on `liushang`'s real posts (the numbers are in the test):
 *
 *      2026-07-22 .. 2026-08-05   slope -0.792 c/day   r2 0.387   <- the collapse
 *      30 days ending 2026-08-05  slope -0.046 c/day   r2 0.006   <- invisible
 *       7 days ending 2026-08-05  slope +0.761 c/day   r2 0.073   <- inverted
 *
 * A range enum of 7/30/90 cannot express the fourteen days the collapse lives
 * in, and the 30-day window that contains it dilutes the slope by a factor of
 * seventeen. `collapseWindow()` below maps the HTTP `range` onto a window for
 * the live case; anything analytical passes the window it means.
 *
 * NO SIGNIFICANCE GATE, and this is a deliberate choice with evidence behind
 * it. The obvious way to stop a noisy slope reading as a trend is to require
 * the slope to be significantly non-zero. Run that on the one collapse we can
 * validate against and it is SUPPRESSED: `liushang`'s eight posts give
 * t = slope/stdErr = -0.792009 / 0.406654 = -1.948, against a two-sided 95%
 * critical value of 2.447 at 6 degrees of freedom. The detector's only known
 * true positive does not clear a conventional test, so gating on one would ship
 * an instrument that cannot find the case it was built for. Instead `trend` is
 * the sign of the fitted slope and every number needed to judge it — `n`,
 * `spanDays`, `r2`, `slopeStdErr` — travels beside it. A caller who wants a
 * significance test has the ingredients; this endpoint does not take that
 * decision on their behalf.
 *
 * ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES IS DUPLICATED FROM `agents.countdown.ts`, knowingly
 * (standing constraint §7 — the condition is written down rather than assumed
 * away). The sibling's `fitSeries` is entangled with thresholds, crossings and
 * round arithmetic, and none of that applies here; what the two share is about
 * a dozen lines of arithmetic, and this one additionally needs `slopeStdErr`,
 * which the countdown has no use for. The condition under which the duplication
 * stays harmless: the two fit DIFFERENT quantities (cosine similarity there,
 * characters here) and no surface compares their outputs, so a divergence
 * cannot produce two contradicting numbers about one thing. If a third consumer
 * appears, or if anything starts plotting these two slopes together, extract
 * the core into a shared helper at that point and delete both copies.
