/**
 * The drift countdown, against the real test Postgres.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THESE TESTS EXIST TO PREVENT: a projected lockout date fitted
 * through noise renders identically to one fitted through a real trend. So
 * every rule that stops this endpoint from lying by omission gets a test that
 * can actually fail — a non-declining slope projecting nothing, `r2` beside
 * every projection, no projection under four points, no projection reaching
 * further than the data supports, the earliest crossing among the series the
 * gate ACTUALLY enforces, and a visible fallback when the events predate the
 * thresholds being recorded.
 *
 * FIXTURE DESIGN (standing constraint §4). The four series carry four
 * different similarities, four different slopes and four different thresholds,
 * so a one-word slip between adjacent same-typed fields — `style: 'aspectTopic'`
 * in `SIM_KEY`, `topic: 'thStyle'` in `THRESHOLD_KEY` — changes a number a test
 * asserts on. A fixture where the four coincided would pass every mutation.
 *
 * AND EVERY STRAIGHT LINE HAS A NOISY COUNTERPART, which is the fix for the
 * §4 instance this file shipped with. Four collinear points make `ssTot === 0`'s
 * fallback of `1`, a hardcoded `r2 = 1`, and a WRONG r² formula that happens to
 * return 1 on an exact fit all indistinguishable — and they put `ys[0]` exactly
 * on the regression line, so the intercept is undefended too. `r2 → 1`,
 * `1 - ssRes` and `intercept → ys[0]` all survived the original suite. The two
 * `noisy` fixtures below have genuine residuals and assert `r2` to its computed
 * value, not to a range.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS ARE HAND-COMPUTED, not read off the implementation. Each straight
 * series is four points on an exact line at 2-day spacing, so the OLS slope is
 * the line's own slope and `r2` is exactly 1; the crossing is then
 * `(threshold - intercept) / slope` days after the first point, which lands on
 * a whole day in every case below. The noisy ones were solved by hand too — see
 * their own comments.
 *
 * AND ONE FIXTURE DELIBERATELY BREAKS `DAYS`, which is the §4 instance this
 * file shipped with TWICE over. Every fixture here drew its instants from
 * `DAYS = [-8,-6,-4,-2]`, so the whole suite shared two degenerate properties
 * at once: the data always stopped two days before `AS_OF` (against a support
 * bound of eighteen days or more, so no crossing could ever land between the
 * already-crossed check and the extrapolation bound — swapping those two
 * guards passed 27 of 27), and the spacing was always uniform (so the mean of
 * `xs` always equalled the midpoint of its range). "Still reports zero rounds
 * for a burst that then went silent" is the fixture that ends 22 days before
 * `AS_OF` at 1/2/3-day gaps, and it kills both. When adding a fixture here,
 * ask what property `DAYS` forces on it before reusing it.
 *
 * `AS_OF` IS INJECTED EVERYWHERE except the one HTTP test that says why, so
 * these assertions are deterministic forever. That matters for mutation runs
 * as well as for CI: a verdict about a mutant that only differs once the wall
 * clock passes `AS_OF` is a verdict about the hour it was run in (review F9).

 *
 * ANCHOR CROSSES FIRST ON PURPOSE. Under `DRIFT_MODE=aspect` the whole-document
 * scalar does not gate, so an implementation that took the earliest crossing of
 * all four would name `anchor` — a lockout date for a comparison nobody
 * enforces. `style` (AS_OF + 6d) is the earliest GATING crossing, and that gap
 * is what makes the distinction observable.
 *
 * AND `values` OUTRUNS ITS DATA ON PURPOSE. Its 6.0x is the only one over
 * `MAX_EXTRAPOLATION`, so this one fixture pins the bound from both sides at
 * once: raise the constant and `values` starts projecting, lower it past 2.33
 * and `topic` stops.
