/**
 * Drift countdown — how many rounds until the gate locks an account out.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. `dream.sh`'s constitution layer rejects a candidate when
 * its similarity to a FIXED anchor falls under a threshold. The anchor never
 * moves and personality documents accrete — only 10 of 297 recorded version
 * transitions made a file shorter — so distance from the anchor is a quantity
 * that mostly grows. That makes every account a walk toward permanent
 * rejection, and this module turns that assertion into a number: fit the
 * recorded similarities against time, extend the line to the threshold, and
 * report the date and the round count.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It projects; it enforces nothing. No value computed here
 * reaches the gate, changes a threshold, or alters what any agent does. A
 * `roundsRemaining` of 3 blocks nothing on round 4.
 *
 * SIMILARITY, NOT DISTANCE — every number in this file. The other convention
 * belongs to particular FIELDS, not to a whole endpoint, and the distinction is
 * load-bearing: `GET /agents/:u/drift` (`agents.drift.ts`) serves BOTH.
 * `DriftPointDTO.distanceFromAnchor` and `distanceFromPrev` are cosine
 * DISTANCES off `personality_snapshots` (`distance = 1 - sim`), while that same
 * response's `aspects.{values,style,topic}` are cosine SIMILARITIES — the same
 * convention as this file, traced back to `verdict.sims`, which is what lets
 * `/lab` draw `thresholdSim` straight onto the aspect chart as a reference
 * line. So convert by field and never by endpoint: a reader who takes
 * "`/:u/drift` is distance" as a rule converts an aspect similarity of 0.70
 * into 0.30, compares it against a 0.71 threshold, and concludes the exact
 * opposite of the truth.
 *
 * WHY NOT `personality_snapshots`. That table is written only on an ACCEPTED
 * dream (`agent/swil_agent/dream/round.py:804` and `:874`). Fitting a trend to
 * it fits a trend to the gate's own survivors — the exact survivor-censoring
 * this work exists to escape. `agent_events` with `summary='drift measured'`
 * is emitted from `gate_step` on EVERY path that reaches the gate, rejections
 * and structural failures included, so it is the uncensored series.
 *
 * WHY NOT `getAgentEvents`. It caps `limit` at 50 and takes no date range
 * (`agents.events.ts:37`), so it cannot serve a multi-week fit. Hence the
 * dedicated query below.
 *
 * THE SERIES IS NOT EVENLY SPACED. `run_dream` returns before `gate_step` on a
 * cooldown skip (`dream/round.py:1012`) and on an empty LLM response (`:1022`),
 * so the points are "every attempt that REACHED the gate", not "every round".
 * The fit is therefore against real timestamps, never against a point index.
 *
 * AND IT IS NOT EVENLY DENSE EITHER, which is why `MAX_EXTRAPOLATION` exists.
 * Four measurements twenty minutes apart — `FORCE_DREAM=1`, a hand-run
 * `swil-agent dream`, a debugging retry loop, a backfill — fit a perfect line
 * whose slope is nonsense at the scale of a round. Before that bound this
 * module answered such a burst with `crossesAt` tomorrow, `roundsRemaining: 1`
 * and `r2: 1`, for data whose real trend was months out. `r2` cannot catch it:
 * it scores how well the line fits the points, not whether the points cover
 * enough time to extend the line, so a tight burst is exactly where a perfect
 * fit is least informative and looks most trustworthy.

 * when.
 *
 * WHY A RATIO AND NOT A MINIMUM SPAN. The rule is scale-free on purpose. It
 * does not ask "were these points far enough apart" (a burst stretched over a
 * month is just as unsupported a basis for a two-year projection); it asks how
 * far the line is being extended relative to the stretch it was fitted on.
 *
 * WHY 3 — AND WHAT IT WAS FITTED ON, WHICH IS NOT THIS ENDPOINT'S OWN STREAM.
 * On 2026-08-20, when this number was chosen, production held 21 `drift
 * measured` events in TOTAL: one per account, all from a single round, because
 * `gate_step` only began filing them on 2026-08-19 (`d27f1e6`). The series the
 * query below selects therefore did not yet exist at n >= 4 for any account —
 * it could not be calibrated against, and re-running the calibration against it
 * today still returns `insufficient-points` for every series.
 *
 * THE PROXY, named so nobody repeats the calibration against the wrong rows:
 * the `aspect drift: [...] breached (values=..., style=..., topic=...)` dream
 * events, whose similarities are parseable out of the summary prose. Refitting
 * all 23 accounts' aspect series from those over a 30d window (n = 9-20 per
 * account, span 26-29 days — the historical cadence is ~1.4 days between gate
 * attempts, not the 48h floor) gives 17 declining series with a future
 * crossing, and their extrapolation ratios split cleanly in two: eleven at
 * 0.14-1.40 and six at 3.44-11.05, with nothing in between. Every ratio above 3
 * belongs to a fit with r2 <= 0.13 — a near-flat noise slope landing a date
 * hundreds of days out — while every genuine near-term projection sits under
 * 1.5. So 3 falls inside an empirical gap: it suppresses the six meaningless
 * ones and touches none of the eleven real ones. 5 readmits two of the six; 2
 * starts cutting into real ones. An independent re-derivation on 2026-08-21
 * reproduced the gap on the same stream (15 future crossings, clusters
 * 0.171-1.404 and 3.442-11.046, nothing between).
 *
 * THE PROXY IS BIASED, AND IN THE SAFE DIRECTION — which is why 3 stands
 * despite the stand-in. `aspect drift: ... breached` is emitted only on a
 * REJECTED dream; an accepted one files `personality updated` and carries no
 * similarities at all (347 rejections against 135 acceptances). The sample
 * therefore omits the higher-similarity accepted rounds systematically, and
 * adding them back raises the fitted level, which LENGTHENS horizons, while
 * `span` stays bounded by the 30d window either way. So the true ratios run
 * higher than the ones above and 3 suppresses MORE series than measured, never
 * fewer. Over-suppressing is this module's safe failure — it withholds a date
 * under its own name, which a caller can see; inventing one is what the whole
 * bound exists to stop.
 *
 * REFIT CONDITION (standing constraint §7 — this constant is calibrated on a
 * stand-in, and the stand-in has a known bias). Redo the fit against
 * `summary = 'drift measured'` itself once that series reaches n >= 4 per
 * account, i.e. four rounds' worth of history after 2026-08-19. Those events
 * carry `thScalar`/`thValues`/`thStyle`/`thTopic` beside the sims, so the refit
 * needs neither prose parsing nor threshold reconstruction, and it will include
 * the accepted rounds the proxy dropped. If the gap closes or moves, this
 * number moves with it.
