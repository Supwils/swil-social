/**
 * The `action` enum decides which act events reach `/lab`.
 *
 * `dm` and `echo` were missing from it, while `auto-run.sh:290` emitted them
 * anyway — so every DM's and every echo's act event 400'd and was swallowed
 * (`|| true` in Bash, `except ApiError` in Python). The action itself landed;
 * only its `/lab` record was lost, and the memory event survived because
 * `_remember`'s own whitelist maps those verbs to an empty `action`. The result
 * on `/lab` was a memory record for every DM with no matching act record.
 *
 * Found by the Stage 4 canary. It surfaced then rather than earlier because
 * Python logs the HTTP status where Bash discards it with `2>/dev/null`.
